<h2><span class="h3head"><i>THE KAISER AS HIS FRIENDS KNEW HIM.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center allsmcap">BY A NEUTRAL DIPLOMAT.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Among</span> the high German officials whose opinion of William the
Second’s foreign policies I quoted in my previous article, I do not
recall a single one whose loyalty or sense of propriety did not
prevent his offering any personal criticisms of the Emperor to whose
service his best efforts were being devoted. An apprehensiveness,
bordering on positive dread in many instances, of the ultimate
consequences of the Kaiser’s impetuosities was often apparent in
the observations of their franker moments, but personal aspersions
were never cast. This was, of course, no more than could have
been expected from the well-bred men-of-the-world that they were.
And in this connection it may be in point to add that not even
among the rather gay and not always discreetly reserved officers
of the Crown Prince’s suite (with whom I was thrown not a little
during their visit to India in 1911) was loose criticism of the
Emperor ever heard, either by myself or by others who enjoyed
still fuller opportunities than I had for meeting them on intimate
and confidential terms.</p>

<p>Frederick William himself was, I regret to record, far less discreet
than those about him in his references to his imperial progenitor,
and I recall very clearly that quick-tongued youth’s sarcastic
allusions to certain rulings of the Kaiser in the matter of the treatment
of the natives of some of the islands of German Melanesia.
The Crown Prince, I should explain, I had found consumed with
interest concerning the progress his people were making in
several of their Pacific island colonies I had recently visited, and it
was to his very palpable desire to ‘pump me dry’ of any information
I might have picked up regarding these incipient ‘places in
the sun’ that I owed a number of hours of conversation with him
the edification of which would hardly otherwise have fallen to my
lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
The outburst I had in mind was led up to by my royal inquisitor’s
asking me for my views concerning the comparative progress of
the three political divisions of the island of New Guinea, and by
my replying that, if the criterion of judgment was to be the contentment,
physical well-being, and economic usefulness of the native,
I should rate British New Guinea first, Dutch New Guinea an
indifferent second, and German New Guinea a very poor third. It
was anything but a courtier-like speech on my part, but I was not
meeting Frederick William in my official capacity, and, moreover,
he had made a point of asking that I should give him perfectly
frank answers to his questions. (‘None of the “bull con’,” as the
Yankees say,’ was the way he put it; ‘give me the “straight
goods.”’ Both expressions, as he confessed with a grin, he had
picked up from a ‘neat little filly from Kentucky’ he had ‘seen
a bit of’ at Ostend the previous summer.)</p>

<p>The Crown Prince, in spite of his undeniable personal courage,
of which I saw several striking instances in the course of his Indian
visit, is far from being what the Anglo-Saxons call a ‘good sport,’
and on this occasion he made no pretence of hiding his annoyance.
Because, however, as transpired later, there were several other
matters which he had in mind ‘pumping’ me on, he evidently
thought it best not to vent his spleen for the moment on one whose
usefulness was not quite exhausted. This befell subsequently,
I may add, though under circumstances which have no especial
bearing on my present subject.</p>

<p>Tapping his boot with his riding-whip—he had been playing
polo—the Prince sat in a sort of spoiled-child pout of petulance for
a minute or two, before bursting out with: ‘Doubtless you’re right.
I’ve had hints of the same thing myself from private reports. It’s
all due to the pater’s unwarranted interference in something
he knows nothing about. Old X——’ (mentioning the previous
Governor of German New Guinea by name) ‘has forgotten more
about handling Papuans than the pater ever knew. The pater
has put his foot in it every time he has moved in our Pacific
colonies.’ (It may be in order to explain that not only does the
Crown Prince speak excellent English, but that on this Indian visit
he made a point of resorting to English idioms, colloquialisms, and
slang to an extent which at times became positively ridiculous.
I have quoted here almost his exact language.)</p>

<p>Frederick William went on to give me a spirited and approving
account of the manner in which a German colonist near Herbertshöhe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
had put an end to raids on his yam patch by planting on
each corner-post of the enclosure the ‘frizzly’ head of a Papuan
who had been shot in the act of making off with the succulent
tubers, concluding with the dogmatic assertion that the only way
to handle the black man was to ‘bleed him white.’</p>

<p>I had the temerity to reply that, from what I had seen, the more
‘old X——’ continued to forget of what he thought he knew about
handling Papuans, the better it would be for German colonial
prospects in New Guinea, and as a consequence threw my royal
interrogator into another fit of sulks. It is only fair to say that
the ‘interference’ of which the Crown Prince waxed so unfilially
censorious really consisted of measures calculated slightly—but
only slightly—to mitigate the brutal repressiveness toward the
natives which had characterised the German administration of
New Guinea from the outset. The one bright spot in the brief but
bloody annals of German overseas colonisation was the six or eight
years’ régime of the broad-minded and humane Dr. Solf—the
present Colonial Secretary—in Samoa. This tiny and comparatively
unimportant Pacific outpost was the single Teutonic colony in
which I found the natives treated with anything approaching the
humanitarian consideration extended to them so universally by
the English and the French. Dr. Solf may well be, as has been
occasionally hinted from Holland, the hope of those conservative
and intelligent Germans who are known to be silently working for
a reborn and ‘de-Prussified’ Fatherland after the war.</p>

<p>As I have said, the Crown Prince was the only highly placed
German whom I ever heard speak slightingly in a personal way of
the Kaiser, and that impetuous youth was—as he still is—a law
unto himself. Such loyalty and discretion, however, did not
characterize all prominent Germans in private life, and it is to
several of these I am indebted for the illuminating sidelights their
observations and anecdotes threw on the human side of William II.
Of such, I fancy the Baron Y——, who voyaged on the same
steamer with me from Zanzibar to Port Said several years ago,
had enjoyed perhaps the most intimate opportunities for an
intelligent appraisal of his Emperor.</p>

<p>The Baron was a scion of one of the oldest and wealthiest of
Bavarian noble families, a graduate of the École des Beaux Arts as well
as Heidelberg, and to the fact that several years of his boyhood were
spent at Harrow owed an English accent in speaking that language
which betrayed no trace of Teutonic gutturality. He was returning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
from an extended hunting trip in British and German East Africa
at the time I made his acquaintance, and was nursing a light
grievance against his own Government from the fact that he had
been rather better treated in the former than the latter. His
attitude toward the Kaiser was somewhat different from that of any
other German I have ever met, this, doubtless, being due to his own
great wealth and assured position. There was little of the ‘loyal
and devoted subject’ in this attitude, to which no better comparison
suggests itself to me than that of a very heavy stock-holder in a
corporation toward a general manager who is in no respect his
social superior.</p>

<p>‘The Kaiser’s most pronounced characteristic,’ said Baron
Y—— one evening as we paced the promenade, ‘is his overweening
vanity. His “ego” dwarfs his every other attribute, natural or
acquired, and it is idle to try to understand what he is, what he
does, what he stands for—and, incidentally, what the German
people, in quite another sense, have to stand for—without taking
that fact into consideration. It is the obsession of his own importance—I
might even say his belief in his own omnipotence—that is
responsible for his taking the so-called Divine Right of the Hohenzollerns
more seriously, interpreting the term more literally, than
any of his ancestors since Frederick the Great. It is his vanity
that is responsible for his incessant shiftings of uniforms, for his
posturings, his obvious attempts to conceal or distract attention
from his shrunken arm. He is the most consummate master of
stagecraft; indeed, the Fates spoiled a great producer of spectacles—one
who would have eclipsed Reinhardt—to make, not an
indifferent Emperor, but——’ The Baron checked himself and
concluded with: ‘Perhaps I had best not say what I had in mind.
Everything considered, however, I am convinced that it would
have been better for Germany if William the Second had been
stage-manager rather than Kaiser.’</p>

<p>Specific and intimate instance of the pettiness with which the
Kaiser’s vanity occasionally expressed itself Baron Y—— gave me
the following evening. I had been turning the pages of some of
his German illustrated papers, and was unable to refrain from
commenting, not only on the frequency with which the portrait of
the Kaiser appeared, but also of the defiant ‘come-one-come-all’
attitude of all of those in which the War Lord appeared in uniform.
The Baron laughed good-naturedly. ‘The Kaiser’s attitudinizings,’
he said, ‘never seem to strike the Prussians as in the
least funny (they haven’t much of a sense of humour, anyhow):<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
but we Bavarians have always taken them as quite as much of
a joke as has the rest of Europe. Now this picture’ (he began
turning the pages of ‘Ueber Land und Meer’ in search of it), ‘which
is one of the most popular with the Prussians, we of Bavaria have
always called “Ajax Defying the Lightning,” and I am going to tell
you the history of it.</p>

<p>‘This picture is reproduced from one of several dozen almost
identical photographs which have been taken of the Kaiser glowering
into the emptiness of the upper empyrean from the vantage of
a little basaltic crag which crops up at the forks of a road in one
of the Imperial game preserves. I have always taken a sort of
paternal interest in this apparently “to-be-continued-indefinitely”
series of photographs, for it chanced that I was in the company of
their central figure on the occasion when he discovered this now
famous pedestal, and it was due to a suggestion of mine that he was
enabled to turn his find to what he no doubt considers a most
felicitous use.</p>

<p>‘It was on one of the early days of an imperial hunting party—just
the ordinary affair of its kind, with no one in particular from the
outside on hand, and nothing especial in the way of sport offered—and
the Kaiser, not being in very good fettle, had bidden me
remain in the lodge with him to discuss some experiments I had
been conducting on my estates with some drought-resisting barleys
and lucernes, the seed of which had been sent to Germany by one
of our “agricultural explorers” in Central Asia. The Kaiser’s
keenness for skimming the cream of the world and bringing it home
for the German people is only exceeded by his vanity,’ the Baron
added parenthetically.</p>

<p>‘Having heard all I had to report, my imperial host suggested
a stroll in the forest, and it was while pushing on from tree to tree
to study the efficacy of a new kind of chemically treated cement
the foresters had been using to arrest the progress of decay that we
wandered out upon the jutting crag shown in this picture. It was
late in the afternoon, and by both of the two converging roads,
several hundred metres of vista of each of which were commanded
from our lofty eyrie, men were drifting back toward the lodge from
the hunt. The dramatic possibilities of the unexpected vantage
point—the manner in which one was able to step from behind
the drop-curtain of the forest undergrowth to the front of the
stage at the tip of the jutting crag—kindled the fire of the Kaiser’s
imagination instantly.</p>

<p>‘“What a place from which to review my hunting guests!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
he exclaimed, stepping forward and throwing out his chest
in his best “reviewing” manner. “Strange I have never
noticed it from the road. It must be because the light is so
bad here. Yes, that is what the trouble is. They cannot see us
even as clearly as we can see them.” (He frowned his palpable
disappointment that all eyes from below were not centred upon
him where he stood in fine defiance in the middle of his new-found
stage.)</p>

<p>‘“If I may venture a suggestion, Your Majesty,” I said, “I think
it is the dense shadow from that big tree on the next point that
makes it so dark here. Do you not see that the sun is directly
behind it at this hour? The removal of that out-reaching limb
on the right would give this crag at least an hour of sunshine, but,
as a practical forester, I should warn you that doing so would
destroy the ‘balance’ of the tree so much that the next heavy
storm would probably topple it over to the left. It already inclines
that way, and——”</p>

<p>‘“There are several hundred thousand more trees like that in
the Black Forest,” cut in the Kaiser, “but not one other look-out
to compare with this. My sincere thanks for the suggestion.
I will have it carried out.”</p>

<p>‘And so,’ continued Baron Y——, ‘the obscuring limb was
removed, and the mutilated tree, as I knew it must, went down
the following winter. “My look-out now will have three hours of
sunlight instead of one,” the Kaiser observed gleefully when he
told me about it; “I was glad to see it go.”</p>

<p>‘It was a case of one monarch against another, and as the
Kaiser is resolved to brook no rival, especially where the question
of his “sunlight” is concerned, I suppose the sequel was inevitable.
All the same I am sorry that—that it was the monarch of the
forest that had to go down. But though the tree went down,’
he concluded with a grimace, tossing the magazine into my lap,
‘the “Ajax” pictures still continue.’</p>

<p>‘Wouldn’t “His Place in the Sun” be even an apter title than
“Ajax Defying the Lightning”?’ I ventured.</p>

<p>‘Unquestionably,’ was the reply. ‘I had thought of that
myself. But, you see, even we Bavarians are very keen in the
matter of the extension of Germany’s “<i lang="de">übersee</i>” colonies, and it
wouldn’t do to make light of our own ambitions.’</p>

<p>I have set down this little story just as it was told to me, and
it is only since the outbreak of the war, when the mainsprings of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
German motives are revealed at Armageddon, that it has occurred
to me how perfectly it resolves itself into allegory. To the world
at large, but to the Briton especially, is there no suggestion in what
the Kaiser <em>did</em> to the tree, which for a hundred years or more had
shadowed his tardily stumbled-upon look-out, of what he <em>planned
to do</em> to the Empire which he had so often intimated had crowded
him out of his ‘place in the sun’? With the tree he hewed off
a sun-obscuring limb, and the unbalanced, mutilated remnant
succumbed to the first storm that assailed it. Was not this the
procedure that he reckoned upon following with the ‘obscuring
limbs’ of the British Empire?</p>

<p>The foregoing instance of the extravagant vanity of the Kaiser
Baron Y—— told more in amusement than in censoriousness, but
I recall another little story to much the same point that he related
with hard eyes and the shade of a frown, as one man speaks of
another who has not quite ‘played the game’ in sport or business.
It, also, had to do with an imperial hunt.</p>

<p>‘As you doubtless know,’ he said, after telling me something
of how creditably the Kaiser shot, considering his infirmity, ‘a
strenuous endeavour is always made on these occasions that the
best game be driven up to the rifles of royalty, a custom which none
of the Hohenzollerns have ever had the sporting instinct to modify
in favour of even the most distinguished visitors. By some chance
on the day in question, a remarkably fine boar ran unscathed the
gauntlet of the imperial batteries and fell—an easy shot—to my own
bullet. It was a really magnificent trophy—the brute was as
high at the shoulder as a good-sized pony, and his tusks curved
through fully ninety degrees more than a complete circle—and it
had occurred to me at once that it was in order that I should at
least <em>offer</em> to make a present of the head to my royal host. Frankly,
however, I really wanted it very badly for my own hall, and I can
still recall hoping that the Kaiser would “touch and remit, after
the manner of kings,” as Kipling puts it.’</p>

<p>The Baron was silent for a few moments, staring hard in front
of him with the look of a man who ponders something that has
rankled in his mind for years. ‘Well,’ he resumed presently,
‘the Kaiser <em>did</em> “touch” (in the sense the Yankees use the term,
I mean), but he did not “remit.” When we came to group for the
inevitable after-the-hunt photograph, I was dumbfounded to see a
couple of the imperial huntsmen drag up my prize, not in front
of me, where immemorial custom decreed it should go, but to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
the feet of the Kaiser. He even had the nerve to have the photograph
taken with his foot on its head. You have shot big game
yourself, and you will know, therefore, that this would convey to
any hunter exactly the same thing as his writing under the photograph,
“I shot this boar myself.”’</p>

<p>The Baron took a long breath before resuming. ‘I need not tell
you how surprised and angry I was, and I will not tell you what it
took all the self-control I had to keep from doing. What I <em>did</em> do,
I flatter myself, would have been thoroughly efficacious in bringing
home to any other man in this world the consummate meanness
of the thing he had done. The moment the photograph was finished
I stepped up to the Kaiser and, controlling my voice as best I could,
said: “Your Majesty, I beg you will deign to accept as a humble
token of my admiration of your prowess as a hunter and your
courtesy as a host the fine boar which my poor rifle was fortunate
to bring down to-day.”</p>

<p>‘I still think that my polite sarcasm would have cut through
the armour of any other man on earth. It was impossible to
mistake my meaning, and he must have known that every man
there knew it was <em>my</em> boar that he had had his picture taken with
and was still coolly keeping his boot upon. Possibly he decided
in his own mind, then and there, that the time had come to extend
the “Divine Right of the Hohenzollerns” to the hunting field.
At any rate, he bowed graciously, thanked me warmly, and, pointing
down to where I had stood in the picture, said he presumed it was
“that little fellow with the deformed tusk.”</p>

<p>‘My head was humming from the shock of the effrontery, but
I still have distinct recollection of the deliberate <i lang="fr">sang-froid</i> of the
Kaiser’s manner as he directed someone to “mark that little boar
with a twisted tusk, a gift from my good friend, Baron Y——, for
mounting as a trophy.” I was a potential regicide for the next
week or two, but my sense of humour pulled me up in the end.
For, after all, what is the use of taking seriously a man who, for the
sake of tickling his insatiate vanity by having his photograph
taken with his foot on the head of a bigger pig than those in front
of his hunting guests, commits an act that, were he anything less
than an Emperor, would stamp him with every one of them as an
out-and-out bounder? The memory of the thing makes me “see
red” a bit even to-day if I let my mind dwell on it at all, but
mingling with my resentment and mortification there is always a sort
of sneaking admiration for the way the Kaiser (as the Yankees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
say) “got away with the goods.” The Hohenzollern—the trait is
as evident in the Crown Prince as it is in his father—will always
go forward instead of backward when it comes to being confronted
with the consequences of either their bluffs or their breaks, and it
is about time that the people in Germany, as well as the people
outside of Germany, got this fact well in mind when dealing with
them.’</p>

<p>These words were spoken before the Kaiser backed down
when his Agadir bluff was called, but, generally speaking, I think
the action of both father and son since then has been eloquent
vindication of their truth.</p>

<p>Another noble German of my acquaintance who had at one
time been on terms of exceptional intimacy with the Kaiser was
the wealthy and distinguished Baron von K——, who, in the two
decades previous to the outbreak of the war, had divided his time
about equally between his ancestral castle on the Rhine and a great
Northern California ranch brought him by his wealthy American
wife. I met him first at a house-party in Honolulu about ten years
ago, and at that time he appeared to take considerable pride in his
friendship with the Kaiser, of whom he was wont to speak often
and sympathetically. Since then I have encountered him, now
in America, now in Europe, on an average of once a year, and on
each succeeding occasion I noticed a decreasing warmth on his
part, not so much for Germany and the Germans, for whom he
still expressed great affection, but rather toward the Kaiser and
his policies. It must have been fully seven years ago that he told
me, at the Lotus Club in New York, that the mad race of armaments
in which Germany was setting the pace for the rest of Europe could
only end in one way—a great war in which his country would run
a risk of losing far more than it had any chance of winning.</p>

<p>It was not long after this that I heard that Baron von K——
had returned hurriedly and unexpectedly from Germany to America,
taking with him his two sons who had been at school there. I
never learned exactly what the trouble was, but a friend of his told
me that it had some connection with an effort that had been made
to induce the youngsters to become German subjects and join the
army, flattering prospects in which were held out to them. Von
K—— is said to have declared that the boys should never be allowed
to set foot in Germany again. Whether this latter statement is
true or not, it is a fact that neither of the lads has ever since crossed
the Atlantic, and that both are now at Harvard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
In the spring of 1911 von K—— cut short what was to have
been a fortnight’s business trip to Germany to one of four days,
the change in plan, as I have since learned, being due to an ‘invitation’
(an euphemism for a command) from the Kaiser to invest
a huge sum of money in one of his armament concerns, great
extensions in which were contemplated. Von K—— refused point-blank,
rushed through his business, and took the first boat for
New York. I did not see him until the following year, but friends
told me that for a couple of months after his return to California he
absolutely refused to talk of Germany or of German affairs even
with his intimates.</p>

<p>This silence was dramatically broken in the smoking-room of
the Union League Club, San Francisco, on the evening when the
news came that the Kaiser had sent the gunboat ‘Panther’ to
Agadir as a trump card for the game he was playing for the control
of Morocco. Von K—— was frowning over his paper when an
American friend came up, clapped him on the shoulder, and
exclaimed: ‘The Baron is in close touch with the Kaiser; perhaps
he can tell us what “The Mailed Fist” is punching at in North
Africa.’</p>

<p>What von K—— said regarding the allegation that he was in
close touch with the Kaiser was not stated in words that even the
San Francisco papers (whose ‘news vultures’ had pounced upon
the incident within an hour) felt able to report verbatim the
following morning, but his ‘Mailed Fist’ <i lang="fr">mot</i> went from California
to Maine in the next twelve hours, and even to-day is still freely
quoted whenever the question of the War Lord’s mentality is the
subject of discussion.</p>

<p>‘Mailed vist!’ snorted the Baron, whose English has
never climbed entirely out of his throat; ‘Vell, berhabst dey haas
mailed his vist, but, by Gott, dey haas neffer mailed his prain.’
Then, as an afterthought, ‘Or maype, if dey haas mailed his prain,
der bostmann haas forgodt it to deliffer.’</p>

<p>I saw Baron von K—— in San Francisco—encountered him
beaming over the sculptures in the Italian Building at the Panama-Pacific
Exposition—but was unable to draw him into any discussion
of Germany and the war. He did, however, tell me that his German
estates were for sale, that he never expected to return there again,
and that—the day after Belgium was invaded—he had applied for
his first papers of American citizenship.</p>

<p class="center">
BY THE LATE CHARLES KINGSLEY,<br>
REVISED AND COMPLETED BY HIS DAUGHTER, LUCAS MALET.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CHAPTER <abbr title="thirty">XXX</abbr>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> was the first of many days—for by both Braithwaite’s and
Nellie’s request I stayed on at Westrea until nearly the end of
the vacation—of sweet but very searching experience. If I
played with fire it was a purifying fire surely, burning away the
baser metal and leaving whatever of gold might be in me free of
dross.</p>

<p>Not that I say this boastfully—who am I, indeed, to boast?—but
humbly and thankfully, knowing I passed through an ordeal
from which—while the animal man cowered and shrank, crying
aloud, aye, and with tears of agony, to be spared—the spiritual
man drew strength and rose, in God’s mercy, to greater fulness of
life. For I learned very much, and that at first hand, by personal
experiment, not by hearsay merely or, parrot-like, by rote. Learned
the truth of the apostle’s dictum, that although ‘all things are
lawful,’ yet, for some of us, many things, however good in themselves
or good for others, are ‘not expedient.’ Learned, too, the
value of the second best, learned to accept the lower place. Learned
to rejoice in friendship, since the greater joys of love were denied
me, schooling myself to play a brother’s part; play it fearlessly
and, as I trust, unselfishly, watchful that neither by word, or deed,
or even by look, I overstepped the limit I had set myself and
forfeited the trust and faith Nellie reposed in me.</p>

<p>To do this was no easy matter. At moments, I own, the springs
of courage and resolution ran perilously dry. Then I would go
away by myself for a time; and—why should I hesitate to tell
it?—pray, wrestle in prayer, for self-mastery which, with that
wrestling, came. For if we are honest with ourselves and with
Him, disdaining self-pity and self-excuse, Almighty God is very
safe to fulfil His part of the bargain. This, also, I learned, during
those sweet and searching days at Westrea, beyond all question
of doubt.</p>

<p>I rode or drove with Braithwaite about the neighbouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
country. Walked with him over his farm. Talked with him
endlessly of his agricultural schemes and improvements. Talked
with him about public events, too, and about politics. Only once
or twice was Hartover, or Hover, mentioned; and then, I observed,
his tone took on a certain bitterness. He had been up to Yorkshire
on business a little prior to my visit, had happened to run across
Warcop—aged and sad, so he told me. But my old friend laid
aside much of his customary caution, it appeared, on hearing
Braithwaite expected shortly to see me, and bade him tell me things
were not well at Hover.</p>

<p>‘What he actually knows, what he only suspects, I could not
quite discover,’ Braithwaite went on. ‘But I gathered the Countess
has been up to queer tricks. As to that business, now, of the
Italian rascal going off with the plate—you heard of it?—well,
it looks uncommonly as though my lady was in no haste to have
him laid by the heels—bamboozled the police, as she bamboozled
pretty well every unlucky wretch she comes across, until he had
time to make good his escape.’</p>

<p>‘And the Colonel?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘A dark horse. Connived at the fellow’s escape, too, I am
inclined to think. Marsigli knew too much of the family goings-on,
and, if he was caught, was pretty sure to blab in revenge. I am
not given to troubling myself about the unsavoury doings of great
folks, Brownlow. They had a short way with aristocratic heads
during the French Revolution at the end of last century, and I
am not altogether sure they weren’t right. But for my poor Nellie’s
sake, I should never give that Longmoor faction a second thought.
As it is I have been obliged to think about them, and I believe
the plain English of the whole affair is that the Colonel and my
lady have been on better terms than they should be for many years
past. What she wants is a second Lord Longmoor as husband,
and the money, and the property, and—a son of her own to inherit
it. An ugly accusation? Yes. But can you spell out the mystery
any better way than that?’</p>

<p>I did not know that I could, and told him so. There the conversation
dropped, while my mind went back to the letter Nellie
had shown me.—It was a devilish action of Fédore’s, I thought, the
mark of a base, cruel nature, capable—the last sin—of trampling
on the fallen. And yet might it not have been dictated by the
pardonable desire to secure her prize for herself, to prevent pursuit,
inquiry, scandal, perhaps fresh misery for Nellie? There are two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
sides, two explanations, of every human act; and the charitable
one is just as rational, often more so, than the uncharitable. If she
stated her case somewhat coarsely, was she not low-bred, ill-taught,
excited by success?</p>

<p>Thus did I argue with myself, trying to excuse the woman,
lest I should let anger get the upper hand of reason and judgment.
But what was her relation to Marsigli? This it was which really
mattered, which was of lasting moment. And about this I must
be silent, be cool and prudent. At present I could take no action.
I must wait on events.</p>

<p>Meanwhile each day brought me a closer acquaintance with,
and respect for, Nellie’s character; the liveliness of her intelligence,
and justness of her taste. And to it, the intellectual side of her
nature, I made my appeal, trying to take her mind off personal
matters and interest her in literature and thought. On warm
mornings, her household duties finished, she would bring her
needlework out to a sheltered spot in the garden, where the high
red-brick wall formed an angle with the house front; and sitting
there, the flowers, the brimming water, the gently upward sloping
grass-land and avenue of oaks before us, I would read aloud to
her from her favourite authors or introduce her to books she had
not yet read. On chill evenings we would sit beside the wood
fire in the hall, while Braithwaite was busy with the newspaper or
accounts, and read till the dying twilight obliged her to rise and
light the lamp. Much of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott, along
with Pope’s rendering of the Iliad, Hazlitt’s Lectures and Lamb’s
Essays, we studied thus. Shelley, save for a few of the lyrics,
we avoided by tacit consent; and Byron likewise, with the exception
of certain portions of ‘Childe Harold’; the heroic rather
than the sentimental note seeming safest—though from different
causes—to us both.</p>

<p>Often I would illustrate our reading by telling her about the
authors, the places, or the period with which it dealt, to see her
hands drop in her lap, her face grow bright, her manner animated,
as she listened and questioned me—argued a little too, if she differed
from my opinion. Sometimes she laughed with frank enjoyment at
some merry tale or novel idea. And then I was indeed rewarded—only
too well rewarded. For her laughter was exquisite to me,
both in sound and in token of—were it but momentary—lightness
of heart.</p>

<p>After that first morning in the Orchard Close, we rarely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
mentioned the dear boy. I felt nothing could be gained by leading
the conversation in his direction. If it would afford her relief,
if she wanted to speak, she knew by now, I felt, she could do so
without embarrassment or fear of misunderstanding on my part.
But it was not until the afternoon of the day preceding my
return to Cambridge that we had any prolonged talk on the
subject.</p>

<p>Braithwaite, I remember, had driven over to Thetford upon
business; and, at Nellie’s request, I walked with her to the village,
so that she might show me the fine old monuments and brasses in
the parish church.</p>

<p>Coming back across the fields, we lingered a little, watching the
loveliness of the early May sunset. For, looking westward, all
the land lay drenched in golden haze, which—obliterating the
horizon line—faded upward into a faint golden-green sky, across
which long webs were drawn of rose and grey. Out of the sunset
a soft wind blew; full, as it seemed, of memory and wistful invitation
to—well—I know not what. But either that wind or consciousness
of our parting on the morrow moved Nellie to open her
heart to me more freely than ever before.</p>

<p>‘Dear Mr. Brownlow,’ she said, her eyes still fixed on that
loveliness of sunset—‘I want to thank you now, while we are still
alone, for all you have done for me. You have, indeed, been a
good physician, and I want you to know how much better I am
since you came—stronger, and more at peace. I promise you I
will do my utmost to keep the ground I have gained, and not
fall back into the unworthy state of mind out of which you have
brought me. I do not say I am cured.’</p>

<p>She looked up at me, smiling.</p>

<p>‘I do not think you would ask that of me. I have no wish to
be—I should, I think, be ashamed to be cured of—of my love.
For it would make what was most beautiful seem unreal and
untrue. But I am resigned to all—almost all—which has happened.
I no longer kick against the pricks, or ask to have things
otherwise. I shall not let it make me sour or envious—thanks
to you.’</p>

<p>And as she spoke I read in her dear eyes a depth of innocent
and trustful affection, which was almost more than I could endure.</p>

<p>‘I have come to a better frame of mind,’ she said. ‘It will
last. It shall last, I promise you.’</p>

<p>‘Then all is well,’ I answered, haltingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>
But as I spoke her expression changed. She walked forward
along the field path, looking upon the ground.</p>

<p>‘Yes, all—I suppose—is well,’ she repeated. ‘All except one
thing—that hurts still.’</p>

<p>‘And what is that one thing?’</p>

<p>I thought I knew. If I was right, I had a remedy at hand—a
desperate one, perhaps, but she was firm enough to bear it now.</p>

<p>‘I always felt how little I had to offer, as against his position,
his gifts, and all the attractions of his life at Hover, and still more
his life in town. The wonder was he should ever have found me
worth caring for at all. But I thought his nature was deeper and
more constant, and it hurts—it must always hurt—that he should
have forgotten so soon and so entirely as she—his wife—says he
has.’</p>

<p>‘There she lied. He has not forgotten,’ I answered. ‘Here
are Hartover’s own words.’</p>

<p>And I gave her the letter I received after my visit to Chelsea.
Let her learn the truth, the whole truth, as from his own lips—learn
the best and the worst of him, and so meet whatever the
future might bring with open eyes.</p>

<p>Some twenty yards ahead a stile and gate divided the field of
spring wheat we were crossing from the pasture beyond. I must
leave Nellie to herself. So I went on and stood, leaning my elbows
on the top bar of the gate.</p>

<p>Below, in the hollow, the red roofs and chimneys of Westrea
and a glint of water showed through the veil of golden haze.
An abode of peace, of those wholesome fruitful industries which
link man to mother-earth and all her ancient mysteries of the
seasons, of seed-time and harvest, rain and shine. How far away
in purpose and sentiment from the gaudy world of fashion, of
artificial excitement, intrigue and acrimonious rivalries, to which
my poor boy, Hartover, now belonged! Yes, and therefore,
since here her lot was cast, it was well Nellie should know the
best and worst of him, his weakness and his fine instincts alike;
because—because—in the back of my mind was a conviction,
irrational, unfounded, very foolish perhaps, but at this moment
absolute, that the end was not yet. And that, in the end, by ways
which I knew not, once again Nellie would find Hartover, and
Hartover would find Nellie, and finding her would find rest to his
soul, salvation to his wayward nature, and thus escape the fate
of Alcibiades, which I had always so dreaded for him, and prove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span>
worthy of his high station, his great possessions, his singular beauty,
charm and talent, even yet.</p>

<p>For five minutes, nearly ten minutes, while the gold faded to
grey, I waited, and Nellie gave no sign. I began to grow nervous
and question the wisdom of my own action. To her, pure and
high-minded as she was, would this revelation of dissipation and
hard-living prove too painful, would she turn from it in anger
and disgust? Had I betrayed my trust, been disloyal to the dear
boy in letting her see his confession? I bowed my head upon my
hands. Fool, fool, thus to rush in where angels might truly fear
to tread!</p>

<p>Then quick, light footsteps behind me—the rustle of a woman’s
dress. And as, fearful and humiliated, I, turning, looked up,
Nellie’s eyes like stars, her face pale but glorious in its exaltation
and triumphant tenderness.</p>

<p>‘Dear good physician,’ she said, ‘I am really cured at last—not
of, but by love. All that seemed spoilt and lost is given back.
How can I thank you enough? I can bear to be away from him,
bear to give him up, now that I know he really cared for me, really
suffered in leaving me. I can even forgive her, though she has
been cruel and insolent, because she went to him in his trouble
and helped to save his life. And I understand why he married
her—it was chivalrous and generous on his part. It places him
higher in my estimation. I can admire him in that too.’</p>

<p>I gazed at her, dazzled, enchanted, wondering. And then—shame,
thrice shame to me after all my struggles, resolutions,
prayers—the devil of envy raised its evil head, of bitterness against
the rich man, who with all his gold and precious stones, his flocks
and herds, must yet steal the poor man’s one jewel, one little ewe
lamb.</p>

<p>‘Have you read all the letter—read that part in which he
speaks of his first months in London?’ I asked.</p>

<p>For an instant she looked at me without comprehension, her
eyebrows drawn together, in evident question and surprise. Then
the tension relaxed. Gently and sweetly she laughed.</p>

<p>‘Ah! yes,’ she said. ‘I know. He grew reckless—he did
wrong. But—but, dear Mr. Brownlow—is it wicked of me?—I
cannot condemn him for that—because it was his love for me
which drove him to it. He tells you so himself. I suppose I
ought to be shocked—I will try to be—presently—if you say I
ought. But not just yet—please not just yet.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
‘Neither now nor presently,’ I answered, conscience-stricken
and ashamed. ‘You know far better than I what is right. Follow
your own heart.’</p>

<p>I opened the gate, and stood back for her to pass. As she
did so she paused.</p>

<p>‘You are displeased with me,’ she said. ‘Yet why? Why
did you let me read his letter, except to comfort me and make me
happy by showing me he was not to blame?’</p>

<p>Why indeed? She well might ask. And how was I to answer
without still further betraying my trust—my trust to her, this
time, since I had sworn to be to her as a brother and let no hint
of my own feelings disturb the serenity of our intercourse?</p>

<p>So I replied, I am afraid clumsily enough—</p>

<p>‘You are mistaken. And to show you how little I am displeased
I beg you to keep this letter, in exchange for the one you
gave me to keep. You may like to read it through again, from
time to time.’</p>

<p>I held it out. And for an instant she hesitated, her eyes fixed
upon the writing, upon the paper, as though these actual and
material things were precious in her sight. Then she put her hands
behind her and shook her head.</p>

<p>‘No—better not. It is not necessary,’ she said with a childlike
gravity. Her whole attitude just now was curiously simple
and childlike. ‘I have every word of it by heart already, dear
Mr. Brownlow. I shall remember every word—always.’</p>

<p>And for a while we walked on in silence, side by side, beneath
the dying sunset. Upon the hump-backed bridge spanning the
stream Nellie stopped.</p>

<p>‘One thing more, good physician,’ she said, very gently. ‘I
am cut off from him for—for ever by his marriage. But you
can watch over him and care for his welfare still. You will do
so?’</p>

<p>‘Before God—yes,’ I answered.</p>

<p>‘And, sometimes, you will let me hear, you will come and tell
me about him?’</p>

<p>‘Again—yes—before God.’</p>

<p>And I smiled to myself, bowing my head. Oh! the magnificent
and relentless egoism of love!—But she should have this
since she asked it; this and more than this. Plans began to
form in my mind, a determination to make sure, whatever it might
cost me, about this same marriage of Hartover’s. I would devote<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
myself to an inquiry, pursue it carefully, prudently; but pursue
it regardless of time, regardless of money—such money as, by
economy and hard work, I could command. For was not such an
inquiry part, and an integral one, of the pledge to watch over
Hartover and care for his welfare which I had so recently and
solemnly given her? Undoubtedly it was.</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she said. Then after a pause, ‘I wonder why
you are so kind to me? Sometimes I am almost afraid of your
kindness, lest it should make me selfish and conceited, make me
think too highly of myself. Indeed I will try better to deserve
it. I will read. I will improve my mind, so as to be more worthy
of your society and teaching, when you come again.—But, Mr.
Brownlow, I have never kept anything from my father until now.
Is it deceitful of me not to tell him of these two letters? They
would anger and vex him; and he has been so much happier and
like his old self since you have been with us. I hate to disturb him
and open up the past.’</p>

<p>‘I think you are, at least, justified in waiting for a time before
telling him,’ I faltered.</p>

<p>For my poor head was spinning, and I had much ado to collect
my wits. She would read, improve herself, be more worthy of my
teaching when I came again, forsooth!—Ah! Nellie, Nellie, that
I must listen with unmoved pedagogic countenance, that I must
give you impersonal and sage advice, out of a broken heart!—</p>

<p>‘Yes, wait,’ I repeated. ‘Later your course of action may
be made clearer, and you may have an opportunity of speaking
without causing him annoyance or distress. You are not disobeying
his orders, in any case.’</p>

<p>‘Thank you,’ she said again. ‘See, the lamps are lit. My
father must be home and we are late. Oh! how I wish you were
not going away to-morrow. He will miss you, we shall all miss
you so badly.’</p>

<p>I did not sleep much that night.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CHAPTER XXXI.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ancient postboy drove out to Westrea next morning, and
conveyed me and my impedimenta back to Cambridge.</p>

<p>The journey was a silent one, I being as little disposed for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
conversation as he. My thoughts were not very cheerful. Yet
what had I, after all, to make a poor mouth about? I had asked
to know my own mind, and arrive at a definite decision concerning
certain matters closely affecting my future. Now I knew it very
thoroughly; and, as to those matters, had decided once and for
all. It only remained for me to acquaint my kind old friend,
the Master, with that decision as tactfully and delicately as might
be. But how should I acquit myself? And how would he take
it? And how far should I be compelled to speak of Hartover
and Nellie, and of my own relation to both, to make my meaning
clear? For what a tangle it all was—a tangle almost humorous,
though almost tragic too, as such human tangles mostly are!
Well, I supposed I must stick to my old method of blunt truth-telling,
leaving the event to my Maker, who, having created that
strange anomaly, the human heart, must surely know how best to
deal with its manifold needs and vagaries!</p>

<p>So far then, it was, after all, fairly plain sailing. But, unfortunately,
these thoughts were not the only thing which troubled me.</p>

<p>For I felt as well as thought; and feeling is more dangerous
than thought because at once more intimate and more intangible.
A great emptiness filled—for emptiness can fill, just as silence can
shout, and that hideously—not only my own soul but, as it seemed,
all Nature around me. The land was empty, the sky empty.
An east-wind blight spread abroad, taking all colour out of the
landscape and warmth out of the sunshine. Just so had my
parting with Nellie cast a blight over me, taking the colour and
warmth out of my life. For I had been with her long enough for
her presence, the sound of her voice, and constant sight of her to
become a habit. How terribly I missed, and should continue to
miss, her—not only in great matters but in small, in all the pleasant,
trivial, friendly incidents of every day!</p>

<p>After the freshness and spotless cleanliness of Westrea, my
college rooms—fond though I was of them—looked dingy and
uncared for, as is too often the way of an exclusively masculine
dwelling-place. The men had not come up yet, which spared me
the annoyance of Halidane’s neighbourhood for the moment. Still
I felt the depressing lack of life and movement throughout the
college buildings and quadrangles. Cambridge was asleep—a dull
and dismal sleep, as it struck me. The Master, I found, was back
and at the Lodge once more; but, since only a portion of the
house was ready for habitation, Mrs. Dynevor and her daughters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
would remain at Bath for some weeks longer. This I was glad to
hear, as it promised to simplify my rather awkward task.</p>

<p>I called at the Lodge the same evening, to be received by the
Master with his usual cordiality. He invited me to stay and dine,
admitting he felt somewhat lonely without his ladies in the still
partially dismantled house.</p>

<p>‘Unlike the three children in the Babylonian furnace, the
smell of fire is very much upon it still,’ he said. ‘Signs and odours
of destruction meet me at every turn. I dare say in the end—for
I have an excellent architect—we shall make a more comfortable
and certainly more sanitary place of it than ever before; but the
continuity is broken, much history and many a tradition lost for
good. I am only heartily glad you are not among the latter,
Brownlow. It was a very near thing.’</p>

<p>Whether this was intended to give me an opening for explanation,
I could not say. In any case I did not choose to take advantage
of it, preferring to explain at my own time and in my own
way.</p>

<p>We talked on general subjects for a while. But at the end of
dinner, when the butler left the room, he said, eyeing me with a
twinkle—</p>

<p>‘It was a pity you could not manage to meet us at Bath, Brownlow,
for you would have found some old friends there. One of
whom, a very splendid personage by the same token, made many
gracious inquiries after you—put me through the longer catechism
in respect of you, and put my sister and nieces through it also,
I understand.’</p>

<p>‘Old friends?’ I asked, considerably puzzled both by his words
and manner.</p>

<p>‘You had not heard, then, any more than I, that Lord Longmoor
has settled permanently at Bath?’</p>

<p>I assured him I had not.</p>

<p>‘Yes—and under sad enough circumstances,’ he went on, with
a change of tone. ‘Poor gentleman, he and those about him have
cried wolf for so many years that I, for one, had grown sceptical
regarding his ailments. But what of constitution he ever possessed
has been undermined by coddling and dosing. I was admitted
once or twice, and was, I own, most painfully impressed by his
appearance and by his state of mind—religious mania, or something
alarmingly akin to it, and that of at once the most abject and
arrogant sort.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
I was greatly shocked by this news, and said so.</p>

<p>‘What is being done?’ I asked.</p>

<p>‘Everything that common sense would forbid, in my opinion.
He is surrounded by an army of obsequious servants and rapacious
medical and religious quacks, all and each busy to secure their
private advantage while fooling him, poor soul, to the top of his
bent. Our hopeful convert and gownsman Halidane had joined
the throng, so I heard, but fled at my approach. Where the
carcass is, there the vultures are gathered together—a repulsive
and odious sight, showing the case of Dives may after all be hardly
less miserable than that of Lazarus.’</p>

<p>The Master paused.</p>

<p>‘Lady Longmoor is there too; and heaven forgive me, Brownlow,’
he added, ‘I could not but wonder what sentiments that
remarkably fair lady really entertains towards her lord. She
confided in me in the most charming manner; yet, honestly, I
knew less what to think and believe, knew less how the land really
lay, after receiving those confidences than before.’</p>

<p>In spite of myself I was amused. For could I not picture
her Magnificence and my good kind old Master in solemn conclave?
Picture the arts and graces let loose on him, the touching appeals,
admissions, protests; the disarming innocence of glance and
gesture, along with flashes of naughty laughter, beneath the black-fringed
eyelids, in the demurely downcast eyes.</p>

<p>‘Her ladyship’s communications are not always easy to interpret.
They are not always intended to enlighten—perhaps,’ I
ventured.</p>

<p>‘Then you, too, have been honoured?’</p>

<p>‘I have.’</p>

<p>He chuckled.</p>

<p>But, in my case, amusement speedily gave place to sober reflection.
For if Lord Longmoor was in so critical a condition, dying
possibly, what an immense change in Hartover’s position this
entailed! All my fears for the dear boy reawakened. What means
might not be taken to embroil him with his father, at this critical
moment, to injure and dispossess him! Particularly did I dislike
the fact that Halidane had been in attendance. I questioned the
Master anxiously.</p>

<p>‘Ah! there you have me, Brownlow,’ he replied. ‘Lord
Hartover is a point upon which my lady’s confidences proved
peculiarly obscure. She spoke of her “dear George” with a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
show of affection, deploring that the festivities in celebration of his
coming of age next month must be postponed. She had so counted
on seeing both you and me at Hover then, she declared. Deploring,
also’—and he looked rather hard at me, I thought, across the
corner of the dinner table over the row of decanters, as he spoke—‘deploring
also an unfortunate disposition in her stepson to become
enamoured of young women very much beneath him in the social
scale. She gave me to understand both she and his father had
been caused much annoyance and trouble by more than one affair
of this sort. Yet I could not help fancying she sought information,
just then, rather than offered it. I had a notion—I may have
been mistaken—she was doing her best to pump me and find out
whether I had heard anything from you upon the subject of these
amatory escapades. Come, Brownlow—for my instruction, not for
hers—can you fill in the gaps?’</p>

<p>I hesitated. Had the right moment come for explanation? I
believed that it had. And so, as plainly and briefly as I could,
I told him the whole story. I kept back nothing—why should
I? There was nothing to be ashamed of, though somewhat to
grieve over, and much to regret. I told him of Nellie, of Fédore;
of Hartover’s love, Hartover’s marriage. I told him of my own
love.</p>

<p>For a while he remained silent. Then, laying his hand on my
shoulder, as I sat, my elbows upon the table, my face buried in
my hands—</p>

<p>‘My poor fellow, my poor fellow—I had no notion of all this,’
he said. ‘So this is the upshot of your two years at Hover. I sent
you out to make your fortune, and you found your fate. Well—well—things
are as they are; but I do not deny that recently I had
formed very different plans for you.’</p>

<p>‘Do not think me presumptuous, sir, if I answer I feared as
much. And that is my reason for telling you what I have told no
other human being—what, indeed, I had hoped to keep locked
inviolably in my own breast as long as I live.’</p>

<p>Something in my tone or in my narrative must have stirred
him deeply, for he rose and took a turn up and down the room, as
though with difficulty retaining his composure. For my part, I
own, I felt broken, carried out of myself. It had been searching
work, dislocating work, to lay bare my innermost heart thus.
But only so, as I judged, could the mention of Alice Dynevor’s
name be avoided between us. It was better to sacrifice myself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
if by so doing I could at once spare her and arrive at a clear understanding.
Of this I was glad. I think the Master was glad too;
for, his rather agitated walk ended, he stood beside me and spoke
most kindly.</p>

<p>‘Your secret is perfectly safe with me, Brownlow, rest assured.
I give you my word I will never reveal it. You have behaved
honourably and high-mindedly throughout. Your conduct commands
my respect and admiration,—though I could wish some
matters had turned out otherwise. But now as to this marriage—real
or supposed—of poor Hartover’s and all the ugly plotting
of which, I fear with you, he is the victim. I do not think I can
find it in my conscience to stand by, or encourage you to stand by,
with folded hands.’</p>

<p>‘That is exactly what I was coming to, sir,’ I said, choking
down alike my thanks and my emotion. ‘If, as you inform me,
Lord Longmoor’s health is so precarious, the poor dear boy’s
future must not be left to chance.’</p>

<p>‘No, no,’ he answered warmly. ‘His foes, I fear, are very
literally of his own household. If this woman is legally his wife,
we, as his friends, are called upon to stand by the marriage and,
on grounds of public policy, make the best of what, I admit, strikes
me as a very bad business. If she is not legally his wife, if there
is any flaw in the marriage, we must take means to establish the
fact of that flaw and set him free. Whether he is grateful to us
for our self-imposed labours affects our duty neither one way nor
the other at this stage of the proceedings. But, should she prove
the unscrupulous person I take her to be, he will very certainly
thank us in the end. And now, Brownlow, it occurs to me the
sooner we move in all this the better. There is no time to be
lost.’</p>

<p>He gave me reasons for his opinion, in which I fully agreed;
and we sat talking far into the night, with the result that within
a fortnight I travelled, first to Yorkshire, and then up to town.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CHAPTER <abbr title="32">XXXII</abbr>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> my Yorkshire journey it is unnecessary to say much. I
saw Hover once more, stately as ever, but lifeless. The great
house shut up, its many treasures swathed in dust sheets and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
brown paper. When it would be opened again none knew. Probably
Colonel Esdaile would bring some gentlemen down in August
for grouse-shooting, or for covert-shooting in October. He would
hunt there during the winter.—The Colonel, always and only the
Colonel, as man in possession?</p>

<p>I said as much to Warcop—to whom my visit was made—sitting
before the empty stove in that queer sanctum of his, hung round
with prints and spoils of the stud-farm and the chase. Whereupon
he stuck out his bulldog under-jaw and mournfully shook
his big grizzled head.</p>

<p>Yes, he answered, that was pretty well what it all came
to. Would to God it did not!—always and only Colonel Jack
at Hover in these days. And my lord lay a-dying, so they said,
at Bath; and my young lord gave no sign. And her ladyship
flitted in, like some great bright-painted butterfly, for a day and a
night. Looked round the stables and gardens with a laugh, hanging
on the Colonel’s arm, and flitted off again, as gay as you
please, to London or Bath, or Old Nick knew where; while Colonel
Jack, with a face like thunder and a temper like tinder, cursed
the very guts out of anyone unlucky enough to cross his path
for full twenty-four hours afterwards. Colonel Esdaile was a
changed man, as I gathered; his swaggering manner and jovial
good-humour a thing of the past, save at rare intervals or when
her ladyship happened to be about.</p>

<p>All of which was bad hearing. The more so as, without going
all lengths with Braithwaite in his condemnation of our hereditary
nobility, I believed then—and believe firmly still—that if a great
nobleman, or great landowner, is to justify his position—aye, and
his very existence—he must live on his estate, keep in close touch
with, and hold himself directly responsible for the welfare of, all
ranks of its population—labourers, artisans, rent-payers great and
small, alike. The middle-man, however just or able an administrator,
introduces, and must always introduce, a cold-blooded,
mechanical relation as between landlord and tenant, employer
and employed. And, now listening to Warcop’s lament, I trembled
lest the curse of absenteeism—which during recent years has worked
such havoc of class hatred and disaffection in Ireland—should
set its evil mark upon this English country-side.</p>

<p>In this connection it was inevitable that memories of my former
dreams and ambitions for Hover should come back to me with a
bitter sense of failure and of regret. Dreams and ambitions of so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
educating and training my dear pupil as to make him an ideal
landowner, an ideal nobleman, to whom no corner of his vast
possessions, the lives lived and work done there, would be a matter
of indifference; but who would accept and obey the divinely
ordained law of rulership and ownership which reminds us every
privilege carries with it a corresponding obligation, and that the
highest duty of him who governs is to serve.</p>

<p>Where had all those fair dreams and ambitions departed now?
Were they for ever undone and dissipated? It seemed so, alas!
Yet who could tell? Had I not promised Nellie, and that in
some sort against my dearest interests, to watch over Hartover
to the best of my power, and care for him still? And if a poor
faulty human creature, such as I, could be faithful, how much
more God, his Maker! Yes, I would set my hope, both for him
and for Hover, firmly there, black though things looked at present.
For Almighty God, loving him infinitely more than I—much though
I loved him—would surely find means for his redemption, and,
notwithstanding his many temptations, still make for him a way of
escape.</p>

<p>And with that I turned my mind resolutely to the practical
inquiry which had brought me north, questioning Warcop concerning
the disappearance of Marsigli and the theft, with which he
stood charged, of jewels and of plate.</p>

<p>Warcop’s first words in reply, I own, set my heart beating.</p>

<p>‘Best ask French Mamzelle, sir,’ he said, with a snarl. ‘For,
as sure as my name’s Jesse Warcop, she’d the main finger in that
pie. Picked out t’ fattest o’ the plums for herself, too, and fathered
the job upon Marsigli to rid herself of the fellow.’</p>

<p>‘To rid herself of him?’</p>

<p>‘’Od, an’ why not? So long as ye were here wi’ us, sir, what
she’d set her mind to have was out of her reach. But, you safe
gone, she’d na more stomach for my lord’s Italian butler, bless
you—must fly at higher game than that.’</p>

<p>‘Lord Hartover?’</p>

<p>‘And who else? Eh! but she’s a canny one; none of your
hot-heads, rushing into a thing afore they’ve fairly planned it.
She’d her plan pat enough. Laid her train or ever she struck a
match; waited till she kenned it was all over between t’ dear
lad and Braithwaite’s lass. Had Marsigli muzzled, seeing that
to tell on her was to tell on himself. And others, that should
ha’ shown her up, durstn’t do it, lest she opened her mouth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</span>
set scandal yelping after them. So she’d a muzzle onto them too,
and could afford to laugh t’ whole lot in the face—upstairs as well
as down—and follow her own fancy.’</p>

<p>He ruminated, chewing viciously at the straw he carried in
his mouth.</p>

<p>‘And, as the talk goes, she’s followed it to a finish,’ he added,
‘and fixed her devil she-kite’s claws in my young lord, poor dear
lad, safe enough. Is the talk true, sir?’</p>

<p>I answered, sadly, I feared it was so; but that, as some method
might still possibly be found of unfixing those same kite’s claws,
I had come in search of any information he could give.</p>

<p>‘Then you mean to put up a fight, sir?’ he said, his jaw hard
and his eyes bright. ‘For all your colleging and your black coat,
you’re o’ the same kidney as when ye rode t’ little brown horse
across the fells and saved t’ pack.’</p>

<p>And therewith he settled down to recount all he had puzzled
out, all he believed and thought. Inferential rather than circumstantial,
this, alas! for the most part; yet to me valuable, from
the man’s caution, honesty, power of close observation, shrewd
intelligence and mother-wit. In his opinion the theft had been
carried out at Fédore’s instigation, and upon her undertaking
to join Marsigli as soon as it was accomplished, and fly with him
to his native city of Milan. Having thus involved the Italian—whose
long-standing passion for, and jealousy of her, were matters
of common knowledge among the servants, Warcop said—she
evidently played him false, although covering his escape by putting
the police on a wrong scent. Where was he now? In England,
Warcop opined, probably hiding in London, still hoping to induce
Fédore to redeem her promise. Were the two man and wife?
Over that Warcop shook his head. Who could say, save the two
themselves? Yet, if they were, there must needs be a record
of the marriage, which would have taken place during the period
of my tutorship at Hover, at some time when her ladyship was in
Grosvenor Square.</p>

<p>Here, at last, I had a definite starting-point. For the church
could be found, the clergyman who performed the ceremony could
be found, always supposing any such ceremony had really taken
place.</p>

<p>I returned to Cambridge to talk everything over with the
Master; and subsequently journeyed up to town, where, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</span>
seal of the strictest secrecy, I placed matters in the hands of
Inspector Lavender, of the Detective Police. He must find the
church, the clergyman—above all, must find Marsigli.—This was
a desperate game to play. I knew it. Would the dear boy ever
forgive me for interfering in his affairs thus? I knew not. But
I did know it had to be risked both for his fortune and his honour’s
sake. Further, was I not bound by my word solemnly given to
Nellie? Still more, then, had it to be done for my own oath’s
sake.</p>

<p class="p2 center allsmcap">CHAPTER <abbr title="33">XXXIII</abbr>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now we were well on into the May term. The noble elms
towers of dense and solid green; lilac and laburnum giving place
to roses in the Fellows’ Garden; and the river, a little shrunken
by the summer heat, slipping past smooth lawns and beneath the
weeping willows’ graceful shade with truly academic deliberation
and repose.</p>

<p>Never had I enjoyed my daily work so much, or met with so
hearty and intelligent a response. An excellent set of men were
in college that year; gentlemanlike, eager to learn, in some cases
notably clever, in almost all agreeable to deal with. My popularity—enhanced
by that episode of the fire at the Master’s Lodge—was
great. Why should I hesitate to say so, since thankfulness
rather than vanity did, I can honestly affirm, fill my heart? I
had arranged to take a reading party to North Wales during the
long vacation, and to this I looked forward as a new and interesting
experience. Halidane, moreover, for cause unknown, had ceased
from troubling me. Ever since his return, at the beginning of
term, he had worn a somewhat hang-dog look; and, though almost
cringingly civil when we chanced to meet, appeared, as I thought,
to shun rather than seek my society. What had happened to the
fellow? Had the change in his demeanour any connection with
the Master’s visit to his ‘sainted patron,’ Lord Longmoor, at Bath?
I did not know, nor did I greatly care, so long as I continued to be
relieved of his officious and unsavoury attentions.</p>

<p>And so, taking things all round, it seemed to me, just now, the
lines had after all fallen to me in pleasant places. Temptation had
been resisted, difficulties overcome, honour—and my conscience—satisfied.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</span>
If much had been denied, yet much remained—sufficient,
and more than sufficient, to make life a gift, not only
good but glad—though after, perhaps, a somewhat serious pattern.</p>

<p>Then came an afternoon the events of which stand out very
forcibly in my memory. They marked a turning-point; a parting
of the ways, abrupt as it was unexpected.</p>

<p>For, neglecting alike the attractions of the glorious weather
and of ‘the boats’—it was during the June races—I stayed in
my rooms to look through a set of mathematical papers. Some
pleased me by their ability. Others amused—or irritated—me
by their blunders. Heavens, what thick heads some of those
youngsters had! After about an hour’s work, lulled by the stillness
and the sunny warmth—droning of bees in the clematis below
my window, chippering cries and glancing flight of swallows back
and forth to their nests under the parapet above—I laid aside
the papers, and, leaning back in my chair, sank into a brown
study.</p>

<p>The morning’s post had brought me a brief communication from
Lavender, the detective. After weeks of silent pursuit he had
reason to believe he was on Marsigli’s track at last. My own
sensations in face of this announcement surprised me a little.
By all rules of the game I should of course have felt unalloyed
gratification. But did I really feel that? With a movement
of shame, I was obliged to confess I did not. For a certain moral
indolence had overtaken me. I was established in a routine from
which I had no wish to break away. My college work, into which
I threw myself at first mainly as a refuge from haunting desires
and disturbing thoughts, had become an end in itself. It engrossed
me. I found it restful—in that, while making small demand on
my emotions, it gave scope for such talents, whether intellectual
or practical, as I possessed. I found it exhilarating to deal with
these young men, in the first flush of their mental powers, to—in
some measure at all events—form their minds, influence their
conduct and their thought. It was delightful, moreover, to have
time and opportunity for private study; to read books, and ever
more books. The scholar’s life, the life of the university, held me
as never before. Hence this obtrusion of Lavender, hunter of
crime and of criminals, this obtrusion of wretched Marsigli, the
absconding Italian butler, were, to be honest, displeasing rather
than welcome. I cried off further demands upon my energies
in the direction of conflict and adventure. Leave the student<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</span>
to his library, the teacher to his lecture-room, unvexed by the
passions and tumult of the world without.</p>

<p>In fastidious repulsion, in something, heaven forgive me,
approaching disgust, I turned away from both thief and thief-catcher,
all they were and all they stood for, as beneath my notice,
common and unclean. Almost angrily I prayed to be let alone, let
be. Prayed no fresh exertion might be required of me; but that I
might pursue my course, as a comfortable, well-read, well-fed
Cambridge don, in security and peace.</p>

<p>And, mercifully, my lazy prayer was not heard, not answered;
or, more truly, was both heard and answered, though in a manner
conspicuously the reverse of my intention in offering it.</p>

<p>For, as I mused thus, the calm of the summer afternoon was
disturbed by a sudden loud knocking at my door. The door was
flung open. On the threshold a man stood. No learned brother
fellow, no ordinary gownsman; but, with his pride of bearing, his
air of fashion, the finest young fine gentleman I had ever seen—in
long drab driving coat, smartly outstanding from the waist, and
white top hat with rakish up-curled brim.</p>

<p>For an instant I gazed in stupid amazement. Then, as the
door closed behind him and he came from out the shadow, I sprang
to my feet and ran forward, with a cry. And, almost before I
knew what was happening, his two hands gripped my shoulders,
and he backed me into the full light of the window, holding me
away from him at arms’ length and looking down into my face.
He was a good half head taller than I.</p>

<p>‘Dearest Brownlow—my dear old man, my dear old man,’ he
repeated, and his grip tightened while his voice was tender as a
girl’s.</p>

<p>Then, while I stammered in my excitement and surprise, he
gave a naughty little laugh.</p>

<p>‘Oh! I am no ghost,’ he said. ‘You needn’t be afraid. I’m
very solid flesh and blood; worse luck for you, perhaps, old man.
Gad, but it’s good, though, to see you once again.’</p>

<p>He threw down his hat among the papers on the table, tossed
his gloves into it, and drew me on to the window-seat beside
him.</p>

<p>Already the spell began to work, the spell of his extraordinary
personal charm. Already he captivated me, firing my somewhat
sluggish imagination. Already I asked nothing better than to
devote myself to him, spend myself for him, stamp out the evil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</span>
and nourish the good in him, at whatever loss or disadvantage to
myself.</p>

<p>I inquired what had brought him to Cambridge.</p>

<p>‘I am in trouble, Brownlow,’ he answered simply, while his
face hardened. ‘It’s an ugly sort of trouble, which I have not
the pluck to meet single-handed. I cannot see my way through
or out of it. I tell you, it was beginning to make me feel rather
desperate. And I remembered your wisdom of old’—</p>

<p>He smiled at me, patting my knee.</p>

<p>‘So, as I do not want to take to drink—which last night seemed
the only alternative—I took the road this morning instead, and
came to look for you. Perhaps it is a rather presumptuous proceeding
on my part. I have no claim on you, for I have been
neglectful and selfish. I know that well enough—not by any means
a model pupil, dear old man, not any great credit to you. But you
cared for me once.’</p>

<p>Cared for him? God was my witness that I did!</p>

<p>‘And, as I tell you, I have not courage to meet this trouble
alone. It raises a devil <a id="chg2"></a> of suspicion and anger in me. I am afraid
of being unjust, of losing my head and doing some wild thing I shall
regret for the rest of my life. But we need not go into all this just
yet, and spoil our first half-hour together. It will keep.’</p>

<p>And he looked away, avoiding my eyes with a certain shyness,
as I fancied; glanced round the room, at its sober colouring, solid
furniture, ranges of bookshelves and many books; glanced
through the window at the fine trees, the bright garden, and quiet
river glistening in the still June sunlight.</p>

<p>‘Gad! but what a delightful place!’ he said. ‘I am glad to
know where you live, Brownlow, and I could find it in my heart
to envy you, I think. The wheels must run very smooth.’</p>

<p>I thought of Nellie, of my home-coming from Westrea. Verily,
less smooth than he imagined—sometimes.</p>

<p>‘Why, why did not they let me come here,’ he broke out—‘as
I implored them to, after the row about—about—at Hover, I
mean, when you left me? I would have given anything to come
up to the university then, and work, and have you with me still.
Ah! how different everything would be now! But my father
refused to listen. The plan did not suit some people’s book, I
suppose; and they worked upon him, making him hopelessly
obstinate. Nothing would do, but into the Guards I must go.
I begged for if only a year with you here, at Cambridge, first. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</span>
not a bit of it. Out they pitched me, neck and crop, into the
London whirlpool, to sink or swim as I could—sink for choice,
I fancy, as far as they were concerned.’</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>‘It is to be hoped they are better satisfied at the result than
I am,’ he added, with an oath. ‘But what is done is done—and,
curse it, there is no going back. As you make your bed—or
as others make it for you—so must you lie on it.’</p>

<p>Sad words from a boy of barely one-and-twenty, as I thought.
Surely punishment awaited those, somewhere and somewhen, who
had taught him so harsh a lesson, and taught it him so young.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, my first surprise and excitement over, I watched
Hartover carefully, fearing to see in him signs of past dissipation
and excess. But his beauty was as great as ever. His flesh firm,
moreover, his eyes and skin clear. He had matured rather than
altered, grown considerably taller and filled-out, though his figure
remained gracefully alert and slight. Two points only did I
observe which I did not quite like—namely an aspect of anxiety
and care upon the brow, and little bitter lines at the corners of
the handsome mouth, giving a singular arrogance to his expression
when the face was in repose.</p>

<p>We talked for a while of indifferent matters, and he asked
me to walk with him to the Bull Hotel, where he had left the post-chaise
in which he drove down from town, and where he invited
me to dine with him and stay the night as his guest.</p>

<p>‘Give me what time you can, Brownlow,’ he said. ‘Leave all
the good boys, the white sheep of your numerous flock, to take
care of themselves for once; and look after the bad boy, the black
sheep—the scapegoat, rather. For, upon my soul, it amounts to
that. The sins of others are loaded on to my unhappy head, I
promise you, with a vengeance.’</p>

<p>I could not but be aware of curious and admiring glances, as I
walked up King’s Parade in his company. Reflected glory covered
me, while he, royally careless of the observation he excited,
was quick to note the grace of the different college buildings, the
effects of light and colour, to ask a hundred pertinent questions,
make a hundred pertinent remarks on all which caught his eye.
What a delightful mind he had, open both to poetic and humorous
impressions; instinctively using the right word, moreover, and
striking out the happy phrase when it suited him to lay aside his
slang.</p>

<p class="p2 center"><span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</span>
<span class="allsmcap">CHAPTER <abbr title="34">XXXIV</abbr>.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> dined in a private room on the first floor, which overlooked
the street. Hartover proved a brilliant host. Once or twice,
after anecdotes a trifle too highly salted for my white tie and clerical
coat, he checked himself with a pretty air of penitence, expressing
a mischievous hope I ‘wasn’t shocked.’ Shocked I was not,
being no puritan; but somewhat grieved, I must admit, his wit
should take so gross a turn. Yet what wonder? The guard-room
is hardly mealy-mouthed, I supposed; neither, I could imagine,
was French Mademoiselle—in intimacy. To her, by the way,
I observed, Hartover made so far no smallest allusion.</p>

<p>But he spoke of Braithwaite, asking, with an indifference too
studied to carry conviction, if my friendship still continued with
the father and daughter, and—‘were they well?’ I answered both
questions briefly in the affirmative; and there, to my relief, the
subject dropped.</p>

<p>Towards the end of dinner his high spirits, which, entertaining
though he had been, struck me all along as slightly forced, deserted
him, and he became silent and preoccupied. Were we approaching
disclosure of the trouble which, as he asserted, brought him here
hot-foot, to Cambridge and to me? How gladly would I have
made the way of confession easy for him! But I had sense to
know I must be passive in the matter. Whatever confidence he
gave must be given spontaneously. To question him, however circumspectly,
would be to put him off by arousing his sensitive pride.</p>

<p>As the waiter brought in coffee and lights, Hartover rose,
swung out onto the balcony, and, leaning his elbows on the high
iron rail of it, stood gazing down into the street. The June twilight
lingered, disputing the feeble glimmer of the street lamps.
Roofs, gables, pinnacles and towers showed velvet black against
the sweet translucence of an almost colourless sky. Footsteps,
voices, a grind of wheels and cloppet, cloppet, of horse-hoofs over
the stones; the scream of swifts in the buoyant rush of their
evening flight, and the tang of a chapel bell, a single reiterated note.
Some five minutes must have elapsed while these varied sounds
reached me from without. Then Hartover raised his head, calling
imperatively over his shoulder——</p>

<p>‘Brownlow, Brownlow, where are you? I want you. Come
here.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</span>
Evidently he had reached some crisis of purpose or of feeling.
I went out into the warm evening air and stood beside him. His
head was lowered, and again he gazed down into the street.</p>

<p>‘I am sorry, I am ashamed, Brownlow,’ he said, an odd thickness
in his speech, ‘but I am afraid I have come here to-day and
disturbed you on false pretences. I am afraid I cannot bring
myself to talk to you about this matter after all.’</p>

<p>He paused as asking an answer.</p>

<p>‘Very well,’ I replied. ‘I, at all events, have gained by your
coming, in that I have had the joy of seeing you again. Leave
the rest if you think fit. You alone can know what you wish—know
what appears to you right under the circumstances. You
must use your own judgment.’</p>

<p>‘Ah! there you have me,’ he returned sharply. ‘I don’t
know what I wish. I am uncertain what is right. I distrust my
own judgment. In short I’m cornered, Brownlow, miserably,
detestably cornered. To speak looks to me, at this moment, like
an act of unpardonable treachery. Yet, if I don’t speak, I may be
rushed before many days are out, by my own mad anger, into
something even worse than treachery. Do you understand?’</p>

<p>In a sense I did understand, by intuition born of affection
and sympathy. But, unless I was greatly mistaken in my reading
of him, all this was merely preliminary. If I waited, I should
understand, or at least hear, the whole. And that it would be
well for him I should hear the whole I had—God helping me—no
shadow of doubt.</p>

<p>Slowly the twilight expired, while the blue of the night sky,
opaque, profound, travelled stealthily, almost imperceptibly,
downward from the zenith. The joyous scream of the swifts
ceased, and the bell tanged irregularly, nearing its finish. As
it did so, a little group of gownsmen, gathered upon the pavement
immediately below, seized by an irresponsible spirit of frolic—as
most young animals are prone to be at dusk—started laughing
and skylarking, their black raiment fluttering, batlike, as they
skirmished across the greyness of the street.</p>

<p>Whether the sudden outcry jarred his already strained nerves,
or whether the careless whole-hearted fun and laughter of these
men, so little younger than himself, offered too mordant a contrast
to his own troubled state, Hartover flung in from the balcony with
an oath, hesitated for an instant, then blew out the lights and
threw himself into an armchair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</span>
‘No, I’m not strong enough to hold my tongue. Wretched
weakling that I am,’ he groaned, ‘I must blab. And concerning a
woman too.’</p>

<p>He extended his hand, through the semi-darkness, motioning me
to a chair.</p>

<p>‘Sit there, please,’ he said. ‘My God, when it comes to the
point how I despise myself, Brownlow! It’s—it’s about her,
about Fédore.’</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I replied, as calmly as I could, for his tone moved me
deeply. And the subject, too! I trembled, penetrated alike
by fear and hope of what I should hear next.</p>

<p>‘For the last month or six weeks something’s been wrong—some
mystery on hand I cannot fathom. Somebody who has, or
imagines they have, a hold over her is pressing her for money,
as far as I can make out. I believe—oh! it is an abominable
suspicion, but I cannot rid my mind of it—this person visits the
house when she is sure I shall be away. I have no idea who,
Brownlow; but someone belonging to her old life, before I married
her. Each time lately that I have been with her she has insisted
upon my telling her exactly when I intend to come again. Nothing
will pacify her but that I must fix a date and hour. Her persistence
has vexed me once or twice. We nearly quarrelled over it.
She says’—he choked a little—‘it is only that she may be able
to put on a pretty gown, prepare a nice little dinner, and have
everything smart and charming for me. But I don’t believe that
is her sole reason—perhaps I am just a jealous brute—but I can’t.
I wish to heaven I could!’</p>

<p>He waited, fighting down his emotion.</p>

<p>‘Yesterday matters came to a head. I went with’—he mentioned
the names of several young men, well known, not to say
notorious, in fashionable and sporting circles—‘to a race meeting
at ——. I meant to stop the week. But racing bores me after a
little while, and the play was too high at night. Positively I
couldn’t afford it. So I cut my stay short, went back to town, and
to Chelsea. I can’t deny I had been living rather hard, and I was
cross with myself—I really have kept awfully straight for the last
six months, Brownlow—and a bit seedy and out of sorts.’</p>

<p>Again he waited.</p>

<p>‘I let myself in at the garden door, and then at the house-door—as
a matter of course. I had no intention of jumping any
surprise on her. I was not thinking about my suspicions or any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</span>
little tiff we had had. I only wanted to get to her, Brownlow,
because I knew she’d put me into good conceit with myself—tease
and pet and amuse me, you know—she can be devilish amusing
when she likes’——</p>

<p>His voice broke.</p>

<p>‘Yes,’ I said quietly, ‘yes’——</p>

<p>My heart bled for him; but I must be cautious and husband
my resources. The time to speak would surely come, but it was
not yet.</p>

<p>‘I found the house empty,’ he went on presently, recovering
himself, ‘windows bolted and doors locked. I called her, and
looked for her upstairs and down; but neither she nor the maid
was at home. I was disappointed, of course; but I would not
let myself be angry. I had told her I should be away till the end
of the week, so she had a perfect right to go out if she wanted to.
Finally I went into the drawing-room, meaning to wait there till
she came in. But, somehow, I received a new impression of the
house. It struck me as grubby, fusty, low-class. I wondered why
I had never observed this before, or whether it was merely the
effect of my disappointment at her absence. There were scraps
of a torn-up letter on the carpet, for one thing, which I greatly
disliked. I began to pick them up, and casually—I did not attempt
to read it of course—I remarked the writing was in French. Then
I thought I would smoke, to pass the time until she came back.
I wanted something with which to cut off the end of my cigar, but
found I had brought no penknife, so I rummaged in her little worktable
for a pair of scissors. I could not find any in the top workbox
part, and tried to pull out the square silk-covered drawer
arrangement underneath, as I remembered often seeing her put
her scissors away in it with her work. But the beastly thing was
locked or jammed. Like a fool, I lost my temper over it, and
dragged and poked till the catch gave and the drawer flew open.
And—and, Brownlow, inside I saw a couple of white leather jewel-cases—oh!
the whole thing was so incredible, such a profanation—it
made me sick—stamped with a monogram and coronet. I
recognised them at once. They belonged to my mother—own
mother I mean’—</p>

<p>His tone grew fierce.</p>

<p>‘Not her Magnificence. Her hands have never touched, and
touching defiled them, I am thankful to think.—These jewels
would come to me, in the ordinary course of events, with certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</span>
other possessions of my mother’s, at my majority. Meanwhile they
have always been kept in the strong-room at Hover. And, Brownlow—this
is the point of the whole hateful business—they were
among the valuables that scoundrel, Marsigli—you remember
him, my step-mother’s beloved Italian butler?—made off with
last year, and which by some to my mind incomprehensible stupidity
on the part of the police—I have often talked it over with Fédore—have
never yet been traced.’</p>

<p>‘Were the contents of the cases intact?’ I asked.</p>

<p>He hesitated.</p>

<p>‘No—’ he said at last, unwillingly, almost I thought despairingly—‘and
that makes it all the more intolerable. The
cases were empty; and from the position in which I found them
it seemed to me they had been thrown into the drawer just anyhow,
by a person in a frantic hurry—too great a hurry to make sure the
drawer was actually locked. For, if it had been properly locked,
it would not have given way so easily when I tried to force it.
These signs of haste increased my fears, Brownlow. For think,’
he cried with sudden passion, ‘only think what it all points to,
what it may all mean! How could these precious things of my
mother’s have found their way into the drawer of Fédore’s worktable—unless?
The conjunction of ideas would be positively
grotesque if—if it were not so damnable.—Does not it occur to
you what horrible possibilities are opened out?’</p>

<p>It did. I gauged those possibilities far more clearly than he,
indeed, remembering my conversation with Warcop in the stables
at Hover but a few weeks back. For was not Warcop’s theory
in process of being proven up to the hilt? But how could I speak
of either theory or proof to Hartover, distracted and tortured
as he was? To do so would be incomparably cruel. No, I must
play a waiting game still. The truth—or, to be exact, that which
I firmly and increasingly believed to be the truth—must reach him
by degrees, lest he should be driven into recklessness or violence.
I would temporise, try to find excuses even, so as to retard
rather than hasten the shock of that most ugly disclosure.</p>

<p>‘All which you tell me is very strange and perplexing,’ I said.
‘But do not let us be hurried into rash and possibly unjust conclusions.
There may be some explanation which will put a very
different complexion upon affairs. Have you asked for any?’</p>

<p>‘No,’ he said. ‘It was too soon to think of that. I could not
meet her, could not trust myself to see or speak to her then. My
one impulse was to get away, to get out of the house in which, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</span>
it seemed to me, I had been so shamelessly betrayed and tricked.
I was half mad with rage and grief. For—ah! don’t you understand,
Brownlow?—I do love her. Not as I loved Nellie Braithwaite.
That was unique—a love more of the soul than the senses.
Pure and clean as a wind of morning, blowing straight out of
paradise. The love of my youth, of—in a way—my virginity;
such as can never come twice in my or any man’s life.’</p>

<p>He stopped, a sob in his throat. But not for long. The floodgates
were open—all the proud, wayward, undisciplined, sensitive
nature in revolt.</p>

<p>‘My love for Fédore is different—no morning wind from Eden
about that. How should there be? In the interval I had very
effectually parted company with all claims to the angelic state.
But think—she nursed me, dragged me back from the very mouth
of hell; protected me from those who sought to ruin me; gave
herself to me; made a home for me, too, of a sort—oh! that poor,
poor, hateful little Chelsea house!—coaxed me, flirted with me,
kept me from gambling and from drink. How could I do otherwise
than marry her, and love her, out of the merest decency of ordinary
gratitude? I owe her so much—— And now’——</p>

<p>Here Hartover gave way completely. I felt rather than saw
him—there was no light in the room save that thrown upward
from the lamps in the street—fling himself sideways in the chair,
crushing his face down upon the arm of it in a paroxysm of weeping.</p>

<p>Only a woman should look on a man’s tears, since the motherhood
resident in every woman—whether potential or as an accomplished
act—has power to staunch those tears without humiliation
and offence. To his fellow-man the sight is disabling; painful
or unseemly according to individual quality, but, in either case,
excluding all possibility of approach.</p>

<p>I rose, went over to the window, and waited there. The boy
should have his cry out, unhindered by my neighbourhood, since
I knew he was beyond my clumsy male capacity of consolation.
Later, when he came to himself, he would understand I had withdrawn
not through callousness, but through reverence. Meanwhile,
what a position and what a prospect! My heart sank. How, in
heaven’s name, could he be drawn up out of this pit he had digged
for himself? And he loved Nellie still. And, whatever his faults,
whatever his weaknesses—vices even—his beauty and charm
remained, beguiling, compelling, as ever. What woman could
resist him? The thought gave me a pang. I put it from me sternly.
Self, and again self—would self never die? Even in this hour<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</span>
of my dear boy’s agony, as he lay sobbing his hot young heart
out within half a dozen paces of me, must I think of myself and of
my private sorrow?</p>

<p>I looked up into the vast serenity of the star-gemmed sky
above the black irregular outline of the buildings opposite, and
renewed my vow to Nellie—remembering no greater love hath
any man than this, that he lay down his life—life of the body, or
far dearer life of emotions, the affections—for his friend.</p>

<p>And presently, as I still mused, I became aware of a movement
in the room and of Hartover close beside me, his right arm cast
about my neck.</p>

<p>‘Dear old man, dear old man,’ he said hoarsely, yet very gently,
‘forgive me. I have felt for these past twenty-four hours as though
the last foothold had gone, the last foothold between me and
perdition. But it isn’t so—you are left. Stay by me, Brownlow.
See me through. Before God, I want to do right. Your worthless
pupil wants for once to be a credit to you. But I cannot stand
alone. I am afraid of myself. I distrust my own nature. If I go
to her—to Fédore—with those empty jewel boxes of my mother’s
in my hand and she lies to me, I shall want to kill her. And if
she tells we what I can’t but believe is the truth, I shall want to
blow my own brains out. For she has been very much to me.
She is my wife—and what can the future hold for either of us but
estrangement, misery and disgrace?’</p>

<p>He waited, steadied his voice, and then—</p>

<p>‘I know it is no small thing I ask of you; but will you come
back to town with me to-morrow? And will you see her first, and
so give me time to get myself in hand and decide what is to be
done, before she and I meet? Will you stand between me and the
devils of revenge and despair who tempt me? Will you do this
because—barring you, Brownlow—I have nothing, no one, left?’</p>

<p>Needless to set down here what I answered. He should have
his way. How, in God’s name, could I refuse him?</p>

<p>Then, as on that first night of my arrival at Hover long ago,
I got him away to bed. Sat by him till he slept—at first restlessly,
feverishly, murmuring to himself; and once—it cut me to the
quick—calling Fédore by name, as one who calls for help in limitless
distress.</p>

<p>The brief summer night was over and the dawn breaking before
I felt free to leave him, seek my room, and take some much-needed
rest.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>LEST WE FORGET.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center"><span class="allsmcap"><i>A WORD ON WAR MEMORIALS.</i></span></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">An</span> old friend of mine, who was a boy at Rugby under the kindly,
orthodox and dignified Dr. Goulburn, told me that on his first
evening at that great school, a bewildered and timid little creature,
after he had been much catechised and derided by a lot of cheerful
youngsters, and with a terrible perspective before him of endless
interviews with countless strange and not necessarily amiable
mortals, a loud bell rang, and all trooped down to prayers. He
sat on a bench in a big bare hall with a timbered roof, a door opened
and a grave butler appeared, carrying two wax candles in silver
candlesticks, followed by the Headmaster in silk gown and bands,
in unimaginable state. The candles were set down on a table.
The Headmaster opened a great Bible, and in a sonorous voice
read the twelfth chapter of the Book of Joshua, a gloomy enough
record, which begins, ‘Now these are the kings of the land, which
the Children of Israel smote,’ and ends up with a sinister catalogue,
‘The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, one’—and so on for
many verses, finishing up with ‘The king of the nations of Gilgal,
one; the king of Tirzah, one; all the kings, thirty and one.’
After which pious and edifying exercise, the book was closed,
and prayer offered.</p>

<p>My old friend was an impressionable boy, and it seemed to
him, he said, that there was a fearful and ominous significance
in this list of slaughtered monarchs, depicting and emphasizing
the darker side of life. But I have often thought that a few words
from the Headmaster, on the vanity of human greatness and the
triumph of the divine purpose, might have turned these lean and
bitter memorials of the dead into an unforgettable parable. What,
for instance, could be more profoundly moving in the scene of the
‘Passing of Arthur,’ where the knight steps slowly in the moonlight
from the ruined shrine and the place of tombs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1a">‘Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,</div>
    <div class="i1">Old knights—and over them the sea-wind sang</div>
    <div class="i1">Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam’?</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</span></p>
<p>That seems to lend the last touch of mystery and greatness
to a scene of human endeavour, that the earth beneath the living
feet should cover the bones, the hardy and heroic limbs of those
who had lived and fought worthily. As the dying king, with the
poignant accent of passion cries aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="i6">‘“Such a sleep</div>
    <div class="i0">They sleep—the men I loved!”’</div>
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>For nothing surely in the world can be so utterly and simply
moving as the record of dead greatness—unless perhaps it be the
oblivion which is the end of all greatness at the last. There is a
place on the bleak top of the South Downs, a great tumulus, with
an earth-work round it, all grassy now and tufted with gorse, the
sheep grazing over it, which looks for miles north and east and
west over the fertile weald, with shadowy hills on the horizon;
and to the south, where the great ridges fold together, you can
catch through the haze a golden glint of the sea. I never pass the
place without a deep and strange thrill. It is called the Mound
of the Seven Kings; it looks over a grassy space which is known
as ‘Terrible Down,’ and of what day and what doom it is the
record, who shall say?</p>

<p>It seems impossible to us now, just as it seemed to the old hill-men
who raised that tumulus, that as the world welters and widens
onward, the great tragedies and losses and sacrifices which we
have seen with our eyes, and the thought of which has so possessed
our souls with a sense of grief and glory combined, should become
but a tale that is told. But it is one of the thoughts which lie
deepest and noblest in the mind and soul of man, the thought of
old and infinite strife and endeavour, pain and death, courage
and hope so richly blended, till it seems too great for the heart
to hold. The mystery of it is that, as the Psalmist says: ‘I see
that all things come to an end; but Thy commandment is exceeding
broad.’ The thought, if I can define it, leaps like fire
from crumbling ashes—all this great pageant of energy and heroism
and fame fading farther and farther into the past—and yet, in
spite of the hush of the tolling bell and the solemn music, the
certainty that it is all worth doing and enduring, that we must
wrest the great values out of life and make of it a noble thing;
and that while memory fades and honour seems to perish, yet
the seed once sown, it springs up again and again in life and
beyond death, beyond all possibility of extinction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</span>
One of the things for which, in a great time like the present—great
for all its sadness, and perhaps because of its sadness—one
of the things for which I thank God is that this war has revealed
as nothing else could have done the latent heroism of our nation.
If only it could make us poets and cure us of being prophets!
I have often been ashamed to the bottom of my heart of the cries
of panic-mongers and crabbed pessimists shrieking in our ears
that we were a nation sunk in sloth and luxury and indifference.
I have lived all my life among the young, and if ever there was a
thing of which I was certain, it was that our youth was brave and
modest and manly—as this long and bitter fight has daily and
hourly proved.</p>

<p>And we have a task before us—to see that the memory of those
who have fought for us and died for us should be as stably and as
durably commemorated as possible. It is not that I think of a
memorial as being in any sense a reward for the honoured dead.
If there is one thing which our heart tells us, it is that they have
a nobler reward than that. A new life, doubtless, a passing from
strength to strength. But as Shelley so immortally said, ‘Fame
is love disguised,’ and we owe it to our love and gratitude not only
to remember, but to commemorate. I defy anyone, however
simple and stolid, to set foot in our great Abbey, and not be thrilled
with the thought, ‘After all, humanity is a splendid thing, so full
of devotion and greatness as it is!’ Statesmen, monarchs, writers,
artists, men of science, men of learning, there they sleep; there
is a generous glow in many young hearts, which may thus be
kindled. The poet of boyhood makes the boy, just disengaging
himself from the beloved school and stepping into the world, say
to himself:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
 <div class="poetry">
    <div class="i1a">‘Much lost I: something stayed behind,</div>
    <div class="i3">A snatch maybe of ancient song,</div>
    <div class="i1">Some breathings of a deathless mind;</div>
    <div class="i3">Some love of truth; some hate of wrong.</div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="i1">And to myself in games I said,</div>
    <div class="i3">“What mean the books? Can I win fame?</div>
    <div class="i1">I would be like the faithful dead,</div>
    <div class="i3">A fearless man and pure of blame.”’</div>
  </div><!--end stanza-->
 </div><!--end poem-->
</div><!--end container-->

<p>This, then, is our present task—to see that our dead are worthily
commemorated for our own sakes and for the sake of those who
come after. How shall we do it?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</span>
In the first place, we must not do it idly and carelessly—we
must take thought, have a plan and a purpose, not be in too great
a hurry. Hurry is the worst foe of memorials. We have a national
habit—I think it is rather a sign of greatness—not to do anything
until we are obliged; but the result of that often is a loss of grace
and fineness; because people who must act, and are a little ashamed
of not having acted, accept any solution.</p>

<p>What I hope we shall do is to take careful thought where our
memorials shall be set, so that they may be most constantly and
plainly seen; and then how they may best fulfil their purpose,
which is to remind us first, and next to kindle emotion and imagination.
We have an ugly habit of combining, if we can, local utility
with a memorial, as in the well-known story of the benevolent
clergyman who read out the announcement of the death of a
great statesman and added, ‘That is just what we wanted! We
have long needed a new water supply!’ That is like using a
grandfather’s sword to trim a privet-hedge with! I do not believe
in fitting things in. If we commemorate, let us commemorate
by a memorial which arrests and attracts the eye, is long and
gratefully remembered, and by an inscription which touches the
heart, and does not merely merge a man among the possessors of
all human gifts and virtues. I remember a Georgian monument
in a cathedral, where a lean man in a toga peeped anxiously out
of an arbour of fluted columns, and of whom it was announced that
in him ‘every talent which adorns the human spirit was united
with every virtue which sustains it.’ How different is the little
tablet in a church I know on which a former choir-boy is commemorated!
He had joined the army, and had won a Victoria
Cross in the Boer War which he did not live to receive. The facts
were most briefly told; and below were the words, which I can
hardly read without tears:</p>

<p class="center">‘Thou hast put a new song in my mouth.’</p>

<p>What we want, then, are beauty, dignity, simplicity, and force.
We want what appeals directly to the eye, and then darts a strong
emotion into the heart, an emotion in which gratitude and hope
are blended.</p>

<p>I must not here attempt to unfold a wide technical scheme;
indeed I could not if I would; but I may perhaps outline a few
principles.</p>

<p>First comes the difficulty that places like to manage their own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</span>
affairs; and that the men who administer local interests, however
devotedly and industriously, do not acquire their influence by
artistic tastes. The next difficulty is that our artistic instinct in
England is not widely diffused. When Walter Pater’s attention
was called to some expensive tribute, and he became aware that
an expression of admiration was required, he used to say in his
soft voice, ‘Very costly, no doubt,’ and this was always accepted
as an appropriate compliment, he said. A third difficulty
is the deep-seated mistrust in England of the expert—it is all
part of our independence—but the expert is often regarded simply
as a man who lets you in for heavier expense than you had
intended.</p>

<p>It would be well if some central advisory board could be established—a
central authority can hardly be expected, and indeed
would not even be desirable. The nature of memorials should be
carefully scrutinised. We are always weak in allegorical representation,
and perhaps for that very reason have a great fondness
for it. Our civic heraldry, for instance, is woefully weak, not by
excess of symbolism, so much as by a desperate inclusiveness of
all local tradition, till the shield becomes a landscape in which
a company of travellers have hung their private property on every
bush.</p>

<p>Thus with our taste for representing and explaining and accounting
and cataloguing, our memorials become architectural first,
with every cornice loaded with precarious figures, like the painting
described by Dickens of six angels carrying a stout gentleman to
heaven in festoons with some difficulty. Our inscriptions become
biographies. Again, the surrounding scene is little regarded. A
statesman in a bronze frock-coat and trousers reading aloud a
bronze manuscript behind the railings of a city square, embowered
in acacias, has no power over the mind except the power of
a ludicrous sense of embarrassment. A statue, majestic enough
in a pillared alcove, is only uncomfortable in a storm of wind
and rain.</p>

<p>We ought, I believe, to fight shy of elaborate <em>designs</em>,
because the pantomime of allegory at once begins. What we rather
need is simplicity of statement, with perhaps a touch of emblem,
no more, of characteristic material, of perfect gravity, so that the
gazer can see at once that the matter recorded is great and significant,
and desires to know more. It is said that an inscription
was once to be seen in India, marking one of the farthest points<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</span>
of the advance of Alexander the Great. It was a slab with the
words:</p>

<p class="center" lang="el">ΕΝΤΑΥΘΑ · ΕϹΤΗΝ</p>

<p>‘Here I stood’—upon it. What could be more impressive, what
more calculated to sow a seed of wonder in an imaginative mind?</p>

<p>These memorials should, I believe, evoke the spirit of the
artist, as a craftsman, rather than as a designer. Alike in inscriptions
and in representations, the wholesome and humble appeal
must be direct and personal, avoiding rhetoric and over-emphasis,
as well as elaborate conventions which other hands will dully
and mechanically reproduce. If, as in cast metal-work, reproduction
is natural and inevitable, let the designs be perfectly
simple and sincere; if again it be painter, sculptor, carver, or
builder that is called upon to create a memorial, let the responsibility
and originality of the craft be his, and not be superseded
or overruled by the authority of the design—for this indeed is,
as Professor Prior said wittily to me the other day, as though a
surgeon should provide a specification and an estimate for an
operation, and leave the execution of it to other hands.</p>

<p>But we must not suppose that we can insist upon any particular
form of memorial in any particular place. What we may desire
is that the memorial, whatever it is, of this great and heroic trial
through which we are passing, should grow up out of the minds of the
inhabitants of a city or a town, and should be made by the hands
of inhabitants as well. I do not desire that they should be too
costly. Indeed it may well be that we shall have given so much
of our resources to the prosecution of the war that we shall have
but little left for adorning our trophies. I do not desire that
they should be constructed to serve other uses, at least not primarily.
They are to tell their own story, a story of noble deeds, and provide
alike a dedication of our dead to honour, and a dedication of ourselves
to gratitude and future effort.</p>

<p>I hope too most earnestly that we shall not accumulate resources
on one national monument, to astonish tourists and to
feed our vanity; but that as many places as possible should have a
record of a great fact which has penetrated our national life more
deeply than any historical event in the whole of our annals.</p>

<p>Forethought, then, simplicity, naturalness, eloquence of emotion
rather than of word, native feeling, these will, I hope, be the notes
of our memorials. Let us try for once to express ourselves, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</span>
to cover up truth with turgid verdicts, but to say what we mean
and what we feel as simply and emphatically as we can.</p>

<p>We are not likely to forget the war; but what we may forget
is that the result of it is the outcome of modest, faithful, loyal
services done with no flourish or vanity, by thousands of very
simple, straightforward people, who did not argue themselves
into indignation, or reflect much about what they were doing, but
came forward, leaving comfort and home and work and love,
without any balancing of motives, but just because they felt that
they must take their place in the battle of liberty and right with
intolerable pride and aggression. That is the plain truth; and
that is the best and only proof of the greatness of a nation that
it should prefer death, if need be, to all the pleasant business of
life. If this or any of this can be recorded, if this national impulse
can be kept alive in our children, we need not fear either life with
all its complications, or death with all its mysteries. The nation
will live; and the memorials of these dark and great days will
stand to witness to our far-off sons and daughters that their old
forefathers did not live to no purpose and did not die in vain.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>A GERMAN BUSINESS MIND.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center">BY SIR JOHN WOLFE BARRY, <abbr title="Knight Commander of the Bath">K.C.B.</abbr></p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Now</span> that we are entering on the third year of the war so shamelessly
brought about by Germany, the accompanying correspondence,
commencing in August 1914, may interest your readers.
It indicates the extreme rancour against our country of a leading
and capable German manufacturer, not merely evoked by our
declaration of war, but pre-existing for a long time and very carefully
concealed from his English friends. It was to me in 1914 a
curious lifting of the curtain, and indicates for our present guidance
what will remain to be encountered by us in the economic struggle
against the mercantile interests of Germany when the war ends.</p>

<p>The manufacturer’s letter is also interesting as showing clearly
the anticipations held in Germany, when she declared war, of a
speedy and highly successful result of the wicked and stealthy attack
on her neighbours for which she had been so long preparing. It is
astonishing moreover in the extraordinary ignorance displayed, on
the part of a clever leader of German enterprise, as to the Constitution,
resources, and temper of the British Empire, and it gives full
vent to his hatred and contempt of France, Russia, and Japan.</p>

<p>This letter, printed second in the series, was addressed to an
intimate friend of mine who was closely connected with engineering
interests in Germany, and who had known the writer well for some
years, having had important interests with him in business. My
friend sent me the letter for my perusal, but did not disclose the
name of the writer.</p>

<p>The third letter is an attempted reply on my part to the statements
and misstatements of the German manufacturer, and requires
no comment from me. My friend sent a copy of my letter to
his German correspondent, but it evoked no reply.</p>

<p>Copies of both these letters were forwarded, anonymously, by
my friend to a well-known English engineer long resident in
Germany, who occupied a leading and acknowledged position in
that country. He had been for many years closely in touch with
very many members of his profession there, and was connected
with numerous commercial interests.</p>

<p>As will be seen, he promptly identified the German manufacturer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</span>
and his note on the correspondence is placed first in the series in
order to make clear the character and position of the writer of
the amazing letter No. 2. He expresses the astonishment which he
felt at its contents, remarking that the sentiments expressed in it
had been carefully concealed in his interviews with him both before
and after the outbreak of the war. The correspondence appears to
me to give much food for thought in many various ways, and I
may, with these few explanatory comments, let the letters speak
for themselves.</p>

<p class="center">Letter No. 1.</p>

<p>Extract from a letter received by Mr. A. B. of London from
Mr. C. D., a gentleman long resident in Germany and unusually
well acquainted with German commercial life:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="quotesig">Received February 1915.</p>

<p>‘I now see from whom the letter came. He is a friend of mine.
I have had a good deal to do with him lately, also after the outbreak
of war. Curiously, although knowing me to be an Englishman,
he has never in the slightest manner expressed himself in a like
sense to me. He has evidently written to you in a great state of
excitement. Nevertheless I cannot understand his doing so nor
his harbouring the thoughts expressed in his letter. He is a
clever and clear-headed man and much respected. His conduct in
the labour question is looked upon as exemplary. He has proceeded
by quiet well-considered but energetic measures to get his
working staff entirely free from labour and social-democratic
influences. His workmen are all content with their conditions,
and his works therefore free from labour troubles when these break
out in other works. I am told that all works at —— have
profited by his wise measures. I therefore can all the less understand
his writing you such an incredible letter. How can men of his
position be so blinded to the true facts?</p>

<p>‘The reply you sent<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> me sets this forth very clearly. I entirely
concur in the contents and the opinions expressed in the same.’</p>
</div><!--end blockquot-->

<p class="p2 center">Letter No. 2.</p>

<p>A letter written on August 29, 1914, to Mr. A. B. of London by
a German business friend, and sent by Mr. A. B., in September
1914, to Sir John Wolfe Barry for his perusal:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>‘The poisonous seed sown by your good King Edward VII. has
sprung up. It is a well-known fact that the great aim of his life,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</span>
to which he devoted all his energy, was to unite the whole world
in one bond against Germany, to annihilate that hated nation.</p>

<p>‘His disciple Minister Grey has seized the opportunity of tightening
the noose with which Germany is to be strangled. For ten
years English diplomacy has worked for that end, to close up the
ring round us. Now the die is irrevocably cast and Destiny goes its
way. No one can say positively what the outcome will be, but one
thing I do believe, and sixty-seven million Germans believe it with
me, and that is that we shall be victorious.</p>

<p>‘We shall win because we are fighting for the right, for our
national existence, for civilization. Without England’s intervention
this war would have been inconceivable. In France, whom we
sincerely pity, and whom this war will crush, one hears a united
cry that she is ready for peace. In Russia it was only the aristocratic
party that has forced on the war, and they will seize this
opportunity to steal. That party of course owns the anti-German
press, such as the <cite>Nowoje Wremja</cite> and other papers, which are
financed by England. England alone was thirsting for war, and has
pressed the other nations into war against us. For years she has
seen how we have excelled her more and more in the industrial world.
If people were but honest, they would know that the reason for our
success lies in the fact that we are an industrious and hardworking
folk. In England, on the other hand, there exists a widespread
tendency to avoid work. We have no public holidays. Our
working week averages fifty-eight hours. We Directors have no
“week-ends,” we work in the factory on an average from fifty to
sixty hours a week, and as a rule spend one or two nights and sometimes
even all Sunday in the train in order to get work for our
business. Moreover we understand how to adapt ourselves to all
possible circumstances, while your people in their well-known arrogance,
do not concern themselves with the requirements of other
countries.</p>

<p>‘Because we have attained great prosperity by ability and
hard work, the hatred and jealousy you bear us Germans has
grown beyond all bounds. This embarrassing competition must
be crushed so that you can go on in your comfortable decadent
existence.</p>

<p>‘In order that a people, who appear particularly Christian,
may attain this worthy goal, the barbarian hordes of the Slavs
are mobilised against the champions of civilization, to whom the
world owes so much. The natives in Africa are incited against us,
and we are even betrayed in Japan. This last act has raised a storm
of indignation in our country which would alarm you, had you any
idea of it. England will certainly make terrible amends for this
underhand deed. The hatred which is raging among Germany’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</span>
sixty-seven millions will avenge itself on England in a most fearful
way. For a hundred years the fist of every German will be clenched
whenever the word “England” is spoken.</p>

<p>‘I have had many experiences in my time, but never have I
known anything like the satisfaction which prevailed throughout
our country yesterday, when it first became known that your army
of mercenaries had been under the fire of our noble reserves, and
that we were in a position to shoot down the people who draw the
sword for money. Your soldiers who oppose us in the field will yet
learn something of the loathing which our army has for anything
that is English. Our sailors look forward eagerly to the time when
your fleet, of which you talk so much, appears in German waters.
You may be quite sure that a large part of it will never again see
the shores of England, even if we lose the whole of our navy. It is
to be hoped that your fleet will at last summon up courage to attack
us. If they come under the guns of Heligoland and Kuxhaven,
your battleships will share the same fate as befell the forts at
Liège and Namur.</p>

<p>‘In this war, which is the most shameful crime that has ever been
committed against humanity, and which lies entirely at the door of
English statesmen, we shall be triumphant. England will be shaken
to her foundations. Mankind could not but lose its belief in right
and justice, and more particularly in the Divine guidance of the
universe, if a country, who in the most shameless way professes
Christianity and yet allies herself with Asiatics and barbarians,
were to be victorious.</p>

<p>‘Your newspapers, of which we still regularly receive copies, may
overwhelm English readers with falsehoods about our army and its
successes. Truth is going forward, and before fourteen days have
passed our forces will be investing Paris. Belgium, whom you
incited to oppose us, is cursing you. France, whom you likewise
forced into war against us, will in future show perfidious Albion the
door.</p>

<p>‘It is very sad that a country like England which has won for
herself so much merit in the progress of mankind, and has produced so
many able men, should abandon moral principles proved through the
centuries and hand herself over to a band of unscrupulous men like
Minister Grey. When one considers all the misery which this war,
which is the most terrible the world has yet seen, has caused, it makes
one shudder to imagine what sort of conscience the Councillors of
the Czar, your Minister Grey and Minister Churchill must have.</p>

<p>‘Your great philosopher Carlyle has foreseen and indeed prophesied
the moral decadence which always precedes political downfall.
England has become the champion of a band of murderers
who eleven years ago assassinated their King and his consort and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</span>
have now killed a foreign prince. This nation who wishes to be so
great conspires with the most barbaric race which the world
has ever seen, the Russians, and is the brother-in-arms of the most
treacherous, most contemptible, most ungrateful people that the
earth holds, the Japanese.</p>

<p>‘I am sure America will endorse the general scorn and wrath
towards your country. Australia will not be very grateful to
England who wishes to make the position of the Japanese more
assured. I will go so far as to maintain that the British world-empire
will split off in all directions. The world’s history must be
judged by subsequent generations, and the judgment of the world
now passes sentence on your country’s action.</p>

<p>‘If I have offended you by what I have written, just consider I
cannot do otherwise than say what is my opinion. My personal
esteem for you is not altered by what is taking place.’</p>

<p class="p2 center"><a id="ltr3"></a>Letter No. 3.</p>

<p>From Sir John Wolfe Barry to Mr. A. B.:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="quotesig">October 4th, 1914.</p>

<p>‘I have read with profound interest and grief the copy of the
letter of August 29th from your German friend. The rancour which
it displays is beyond words. It is apparently useless to criticise its
contents looking to the frame of mind of the writer, who, I think
and fear, expresses the present general feeling in Germany of hatred
and anger with our country. Many of his statements and arguments
are however absolutely and fundamentally erroneous and are
capable of complete refutation.</p>

<p>‘The poisoning of German thought in respect of Great Britain
does not date from anything done by King Edward and still less
from Sir Edward Grey or the present or former Ministry. It
began long earlier in the antagonism between the military class
and what may be termed the liberal aspirations of many thoughtful
Germans when the Crown Prince, afterwards the Emperor Frederick
William, married our Princess Royal. Both were in sympathy with
liberal ideas and they were violently opposed by Bismarck and the
blood-and-iron school, while the youth of Germany were systematically
taught by the professors and writers of Germany, under the
encouragement of Bismarck and his school of thought, to hate and
despise Great Britain. There is not and never has been a corresponding
feeling here towards Germany.</p>

<p>‘Of course the two countries are rivals in trade and commerce,
but that is no reason for rancorous hatred. We are keen rivals in
trade with the United States and other countries, but such rivalries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</span>
have not engendered any other feelings than that each country
should do its best honourably to succeed in competition. It must
never be forgotten in this connection that in England and in our
colonies Germans, though keeping a strict barrier of tariffs themselves,
have had absolute freedom in competition, that they have
availed themselves of it and have made huge profits under our Free
Trade system. Thus the rancour of Germany against Great Britain
must be sought for in other directions, and it cannot be truthfully
put down to trade rivalry.</p>

<p>‘The cause is in fact to be found in the <cite lang="de">Welt Politik</cite>, the jealousy
of Germany of British world power and in the aspirations of
crushing Great Britain by force of arms. This has been the persistent
and avowed policy of the Kaiser and the Junker class.</p>

<p>‘The idea was to fight France and Russia to a finish and then
concentrate all forces against England (and parenthetically against
Belgium) and to destroy the British Empire. The present extreme
and violent hatred on the part of Germany is due to the probability
of the failure of that deep-laid scheme in consequence of England
supporting her Allies, and refusing to break her pledged word to
Belgium. It may be also caused by the feeling which must be
somewhere embedded in German thought, that Germany has
behaved dishonourably and scandalously to Belgium, whose neutrality
she most solemnly guaranteed.</p>

<p>‘If one looks back on the history of the last twenty-five years,
or thereabouts, one sees Bismarck threatening an unprovoked
war with France, and only withdrawing under the threat of the
opposition of Russia and Great Britain. This proposed attack
on France by Bismarck was a most shameful episode, for France’s
only offence was her existence and recuperative power after her
disasters in 1870. Then came the Emperor’s policy in our South
African War, when, if he could have done so, he would have arrayed
Europe against this country, but ended only in having lured Kruger
to ruin. Then came the “mailed fist” in China, the seizure of
Tsing-tau, and Germany’s efforts to crush Japan after the Russo-Japanese
war. The demonstrations at Tangiers and Agadir
occurred soon afterwards, with more threats of an European war.
Afterwards came the annexation of Bosnia by Austria backed by
Germany and the insults hurled at Russia by Germany in “shining
armour.”</p>

<p>‘It is these things and others of a similar nature when the
German “sabre has been rattled” constantly in the face of Europe,
that demonstrated that Germany was the enemy of peace, and
which, crowned by the breach of the Treaty of Belgium, showed to
the Allies that no treaty would hold Germany, and that her aspirations
and lust for world power were Napoleonic. Lastly the Allies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</span>
knew that Germany had resolved on war and was making a catspaw
of Austria by preventing her from coming to an agreement with
Servia and Russia.</p>

<p>‘I have said nothing about the systematic building of the
German navy. It was within her rights as a Sovereign Power,
but none the less the avowed object was to seize the “Trident of
the Seas” and to attack Great Britain. It was obviously intended
to attack our coasts, so as to enable an invasion of this country to
be possible, and to seize the colonies of Great Britain and France.</p>

<p>‘Germany was utterly deceived by her diplomatists about
England, which was troubled with threats of civil war and by
trade disputes, and they never thought that we would stand up
for Belgium and fight now rather than later. It is chagrin at the
miscalculation, combined with the effects of our maritime power,
which has produced the outburst of hatred against us. Commercial
rivalry has no real basis for hatred, and as for the question
of a “place in the sun,” Germany has large and advantageous
colonial possessions but can do but little with those which she
owns, and has preferred to compete with us in our colonies as she
has done so long and so successfully.</p>

<p>‘All this history of German jealousy, hatred and designs is very
sad, and I do not suppose that your German friend, obsessed as he is,
would listen to any facts or arguments. But since I began to write,
somewhat hurriedly, to you I have been led on to write more than
I intended to try to deal with. I do not imagine that he has seen
or would be allowed to see the statement of the British case in the
White Paper, which I understand will be further elaborated in a new
paper to be published next Tuesday.</p>

<p>‘Have you answered your friend’s letter, or have you looked upon
it as hopeless to do so? In the temper in which he wrote there was
nothing visible but fighting to a finish.</p>

<p class="p2">(<i>The time is the present day. St. Anthony is discovered seated
on the ground outside his hut. The cross stands in its accustomed
place, erect before him; and the great panorama, of which he is
now weary, lies below him. He has changed but slightly with the
years; something of his old immobility has disappeared. He occasionally
shrugs his shoulders when speaking, and he often accompanies
his reflections with slight gestures of the hands.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>thinking</i>). I have attained peace. Those troubling
visions have disappeared. Never for an instant have I departed
from grace since the Saviour’s face appeared to me in its shining
disc of gold. The burning days and solemn nights pass noiselessly.
Rare tempests mutter unnoticed about me. Nothing has power
to disturb my beatific monotony; nor hope, nor fear, nor love,
nor regrets. I have triumphed over all temptations. The devil
has left me. (<i>He sighs.</i>) That journey through space, upborne
on his wings! (<i>Stars commence to shine: the daylight lingers.</i>)
I have resisted all the seductions of the flesh. I value not the
riches of the mind. (<i>He starts, and looks fixedly at a vague light
which advances across the desert.</i>) It seems as if——. But that
cannot be: I have already sustained all assaults.</p>

<p>(<i>The light approaches rapidly. It is rose-coloured; within it
a figure is dimly visible. With a thunderous noise it rolls to within
ten paces of the saint. The air shakes and for an instant the stars
are obscured. This passes: the light fades, and the form of a woman
is perceived, upright, robed in white, her face stern and majestic.
The sleeves of her garment are very wide, reaching to the ground.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>slightly raising her right arm</i>). I have need
of you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>stammering</i>). What mean you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> I am your creator. Much study and great gifts
came together for your making. They also were my children.
My best blood flows in your veins. My name must mean everything
to you, for you are wholly a product of my essence. I am
called La France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>pales and gazes fixedly at his visitor</i>). I belong
to God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</span>
<span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>sternly</i>). Do you deny that you are French?
(<i>Anthony blushes and averts his gaze. He becomes sulky.</i>) What
existence have you had apart from France? Would the world
still hold you, you and your temptations, apart from——</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>starting up and with outstretched hands</i>). Say not that
name! Say it not! (<i>He places his fingers in his ears and then, observing
that the woman’s lips do not move, lowers his hands.</i>) Speak!
but avoid that name. I can endure aught else.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>speaks, her arms hanging by her sides. Her head
is thrown slightly back. Her words come slowly. Her voice is as
the sound of a solemn sea plunging in distant caverns</i>). The hour
of my agony is upon me. I am beset. My strength is great,
my courage greater, and my pride reaches to the stars. But I
have mighty foes, skilled in all cruel arts. I suffer. I dwell in
the shadow of pain. My woes increase and the issue is doubtful.
(<i>She stretches her hands towards Anthony.</i>) Can you remain aloof?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>frowning</i>). This touches me not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>with irony</i>). Have you, then, purified your
heart of all compassion? (<i>Anthony shrugs his shoulders with a
gesture of indifference.</i>) Are you, indeed, amongst the noblest
of my offspring? My sons have sacrificed life for me: they
have been content to forgo their ardent curiosities for my sake.
What holds you back?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>with great dignity</i>). I seek union with God. The
Devil himself tempted me for many days. He failed. How, then,
can you succeed? (<i>Softly.</i>) You cannot, even if you be he.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>flinging her arms apart, and letting them drop
heavily</i>). Shame cannot move you. But he who aids me receives
great rewards. I will show you visions.</p>

<p>(<i>She waves her hand. A cloud descends, swaying slowly in
the air. It unwinds in sluggish masses till it fills the horizon. It
glows with pale fire. Upon it are cities and wide plains. It is a
very clean, neat, and precise land. Rivers wind gently between ploughed
fields, red and brown. The cloud surges nearer, and presently Anthony
discerns an immense temple shining in the sun. It approaches
more quickly, its crystalline walls sending innumerable shafts of
light before it. Anthony and his companion are enveloped in an insupportable
radiance, and the next instant they find they are within
the building. Facing them is a great altar, its gold shining dully
in the light of a thousand lighted candles. The flags of France droop
motionless about the altar; upon it the carved figure of a soldier<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</span>
lies prone. The pavement of the temple is invisible under the feet
of the silent crowd. Mighty columns rush upward and are lost in
the sweep of the dim roof. The air begins to pulsate with the
heavy notes of an organ. Anthony and The Woman are floating
above the heads of the multitude. None have observed them.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>motioning to the crowd</i>). Here are assembled
rich and poor, wise men and fools; judges, statesmen, poets,
the criminal and the peasant. All France is here, united in a
common gratitude.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony.</span> What do they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> They honour the dead. (<i>She points to the
prone figure on the altar.</i>) The soldiers who saved France.</p>

<p>(<i>A trumpet note is heard and the air rustles with the inclining
of a myriad heads. A sweet singing arises behind the altar. A procession
slowly passes before it. The first to pass is a man beyond
middle age, with a grave, bearded face, a broad white forehead and
serene eyes. He kneels for an instant and passes on.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> The Philosophy of France. (<i>A young man,
with a dark, keen face, and a very penetrating look, follows. Each
figure, on arriving before the altar, kneels and passes on.</i>) The Science
of France.</p>

<p>(<i>Then follow the Literature of France, an old man, very harmoniously
dressed; the Music and Painting of France, two smaller
figures; the Statesmanship and Laws of France, superb men, but
badly clothed. There follow priests, merchants, scribes, criminals
and courtesans. Anthony and his companion begin to soar
higher. The music fades; the bowed heads of the people become
indistinct. There is a period of darkness, and Anthony finds himself
back on his rock. Before him stands The Woman. The great
cloud has utterly vanished.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> You have seen the greatness of France.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). It is a land not without merit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Many have died for it. Many more must
die for it, or it will be a stricken land. Is it worth dying
for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>who has grown more argumentative with the years,
hesitates. Then</i>:) That depends! (<i>He faces The Woman with a
stern and questioning look.</i>) Much knowledge and beauty lie within
the borders of your land, but no man should die for knowledge
or beauty. A man’s life belongs to God alone. Do your
great ones serve God? Do they use their wisdom more fully to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</span>
understand His counsels? Do they create beauty to glorify
His praise? (<i>The Woman does not answer.</i>) I will die for you
if my death serves God. I will not die to extend your borders,
to add beauty to your palaces, to make you more skilled in wisdom.
Will my death bring you nearer to God?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>regards Anthony sadly</i>). You ask me hard
questions. Are there not many ways of serving God? I worship
God in His creation. I meditate on the laws of His universe.
I reveal to the world the beauty of His handiwork. Do I not therefore
serve God?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>drily</i>). Does that heresy still flourish? God
is not His creation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> Is knowledge to vanish from the earth? Must
none seek after beauty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>raising his right hand and speaking with deliberation</i>).
None may seek knowledge for the sake of wisdom. None may
seek beauty for the sake of happiness. These things are but the
raiment of God. Your great ones count the threads in God’s
garment, but do they seek God? (<i>He delicately shrugs his shoulders.</i>)
Does France worship clothes?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>sad and bewildered</i>). I do not understand.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>regards her long and then speaks gently</i>). You will
never understand, for you are La France. You cannot see
without eyes, nor hear without ears. You are the cleverest and
most limited of God’s children.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>stands still, her arms hanging limp, her head
bowed. Suddenly she raises her head</i>). But I suffer!</p>

<p>(<i>The air grows dim and a cold wind rises. The stars vanish.
In the valley, mysteriously visible, Anthony sees a road. It is cumbered
with dead and wounded men, lying in all attitudes, some as if asleep,
head resting on arm, and some contorted hideously. Anthony notes
the curious attitude of one man who seems to have his legs drawn
right up under him; until presently he sees that he has no legs. A dead
man sits propped against a gun. The whole of his tongue is visible,
hanging downwards; the lower jaw is shot away. Presently one
of the black shapes starts to flounder clumsily. In the mysterious
light comes the glint of steel; the black shape is trying to fix the end
of a bayonet in the ground. In one of his clumsy attempts the man
reveals the fact that he has but one arm. For some minutes he struggles
and finally the bayonet is fixed. The man lies still. Then he raises
himself awkwardly on his one arm till the bayonet point touches his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</span>
chest; he flings his arm straight out and falls with his whole weight
on the point. A long red finger points up from his back.</i></p>

<p><i>The Woman waves her arm and the scene vanishes, to be replaced
by another. A soldier, young, and with a look of bright intelligence,
is saying farewell to his mother at the door of a cottage.
The old woman’s face is lined; her hands tremble. Her eyes peer
up anxiously at the young man, as she fondles the sleeve of his tunic.
He speaks confidently and cheerfully, and after a final embrace
walks briskly away. The old woman enters the cottage and sits
there, in silence and alone. She picks up a book the young man
had been reading and very carefully places it in a drawer.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> An only child, and she a widow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>looks very thoughtful</i>). What of her son?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman.</span> His agony is greater. He feels all her grief
and his own. She feels but her own, for his leave-taking deceived
her, and she believes he has joy in battle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anthony</span> (<i>as if musing</i>). Will men do so much to keep
France?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Woman</span> (<i>softly</i>). They do much more. They know the
issue is doubtful. They sacrifice so much, knowing the sacrifice
may be in vain. (<i>Anthony raises his head and looks very intently
at The Woman; she continues, her eyes glowing.</i>) For years you have
suffered on your rock. You suffer to save yourself. Jesus, your
master, suffered to save the world. (<i>She stretches out her arms
and her voice rings with triumph.</i>) I offer you greater suffering.
He who suffers for me knows not the fruit of his suffering. I offer
you the opportunity of the greatest sacrifice: the sacrifice of all,
knowing that your all may be in vain.</p>

<p>(<i>The Woman pauses, her arms outspread. Anthony presses
his hands to his head, and remains silent for a long time. Then,
taking a step forward, he places his right hand in that of The Woman.
They slowly leave the ground. As they mount in the air the few
retarded rays of light utterly vanish, and blackest night confounds
the jutting rock with the starless heaven.</i>)</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>THE OLD CONTEMPTIBLES: THE GOOD WORD.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center">BY BOYD CABLE.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">It</span> is quite inadequate to say that the troops were worn out, and
indeed it is hard to find words to convey to anyone who has not
experienced some days of a mixture of fighting and forced marching
how utterly exhausted, how dead beat, how stupefied and numbed
in mind and body the men were. For four days and nights they
had fought and dug trenches and marched, and fought again, and
halted to dig again, and fought again, and extricated themselves
under hailing bullets and pouring shells from positions they never
expected to leave alive, only to scramble together into some sort
of ragged-shaped units and march again. And all this was under
a fierce August sun, with irregular meals and sometimes no meals,
at odd times with a scarcity or complete want of water, at all
times with a burning lack and want of sleep.</p>

<p>This want of sleep was the worst of it all. Any sort of fighting
is heavy sleep inducing; when it is prolonged for days and nights
without one good full, satisfying sleep, the desire for rest becomes
a craving, an all-absorbing aching passion. At first a man wants
a bed or space to lie down and stretch his limbs and pillow his
head and sink into dreamless oblivion; at last he would give his
last possession merely to be allowed to lean against a wall, to stand
upright on his feet and close his eyes. To keep awake is torture,
to lift and move each foot is a desperate effort, to keep the burning
eyes open and seeing an agony. It takes the most tremendous
effort of will to contemplate another five minutes of wakefulness,
another hundred yards to be covered; and here were hours, endless
hours, of wakefulness, miles and tens of miles to be covered.</p>

<p>Cruelly hard as the conditions were for the whole retreating
army, the rear-guard suffered the worst by a good deal. They
were under the constant threat of attack, were halted every now
and then under that threat or to allow the main body to keep a
sufficient distance, had to make some attempt to dig in again,
had to endure spasmodic shelling either in their shallow trenches
or as they marched along the road.</p>

<p>By the fourth day the men were reduced to the condition of
automatons. They marched—no, it could hardly be said any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</span>
longer that they ‘marched’; they stumbled and staggered along
like drunken men; their chins were sunk on their chests, their
jaws hung slack, their eyes were set in a fixed and glassy stare, or
blinked, and shut and opened heavily, slowly, and drowsily, their
feet trailed draggingly, their knees sagged under them. When
the word passed to halt, the front ranks took a minute or two to
realise its meaning and obey, and the ranks behind bumped into
them and raised heads and vacant staring eyes for a moment and
let them drop again in a stupor of apathy. The change, the cessation
of automatic motion was too much for many men; once halted
they could no longer keep their feet, and dropped and sat or rolled
helplessly to lie in the dust of the road. These men who fell were
almost impossible to rouse. They sank into sleep that was almost
a swoon, and no shaking or calling or cursing could rouse them
or get them up again. The officers, knowing this, tried to keep
them from sitting or lying down, moved, staggering themselves
as they walked, to and fro along the line, exhorting, begging, beseeching,
or scolding and swearing and ordering the men to keep
up, to stand, to be ready to move on. And when the order was
given again, the pathetically ridiculous order to ‘Quick march,’
the front ranks slowly roused and shuffled off, and the rear stirred
slowly and with an effort heaved their rifles over their shoulders
again and reeled after the leaders.</p>

<p>Scores of the men had abandoned packs and haversacks, all
of them had cast away their overcoats. Many had taken their
boots off and marched with rags or puttees wound round their
blistered and swollen feet. But no matter what one or other or
all had thrown away, there was no man without his rifle, his full
ammunition pouches, and his bayonet. These things weighed
murderously, cut deep and agonisingly into the shoulders, cramped
arms and fingers to an aching numbness; but every man clung to
them, had never a thought of throwing them into the ditch, although
many of them had many thoughts of throwing themselves there.</p>

<p>Many fell out—fell out in the literal as well as the drill sense of
the word; swerved to the side of the road and missed foot in the
ditch and fell there, or stumbled in the ranks, tripped, lacking the
brain or body quickness to recover themselves, collapsed, and rolled
and lay helpless. Others, again, gasped a word or two to a comrade
or an N.C.O., stumbled out of the ranks to the roadside, sank down
with hanging head and rounded shoulders to a sitting position.
Few or none of these men deliberately lay down. They sat till the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</span>
regiment had plodded his trailing length past, tried to stagger to
knees and feet, succeeded, and stood swaying a moment, and then
lurched off after the rear ranks; or failed, stared stupidly after
them, collapsed again slowly and completely. All these were left
to lie where they fell. It was useless to urge them to move, because
every officer and N.C.O. knew that no man gave up while he had
an ounce of strength or energy left to carry on, that orders or
entreaties had less power to keep a man moving than his own dogged
pluck and will, that when these failed to keep a man going nothing
else could succeed.</p>

<p>All were not, of course, so hopelessly done as this. There were
still a number of the tougher muscled, the firmer willed, who kept
their limbs moving with conscious volition, who still retained some
thinking power, who even at times exchanged a few words or a
mouthful of curses. These, and the officers, kept the whole together,
kept them moving by force of example, set the pace for them and
gave them the direction. Most of them were in the leading ranks
of their own companies, merely because their greater energy had
carried them there past and through the ranks of those whose minds
were nearly or quite a blank, whose bodies were more completely
exhausted, whose will-power was reduced to a blind and sheep-like
instinct to follow a leader, move when and where the dimly seen
khaki form or tramping boots in front of them moved, stop when
and where they stopped.</p>

<p>The roads by which the army was retreating were cumbered
and in places choked and blocked with fugitive peasantry fleeing
from the advancing Germans, spurred into and upon their flight
by the tales that reached them of ravished Belgium, by first-hand
accounts of the murder of old men and women and children, of
rape and violation and pillage and burning. Their slow, crawling
procession checked and hindered the army transport, added to the
trials of the weary troops by making necessary frequent halts and
deviations off the road and back to it to clear some block in the
traffic where a cart had broken down, or where worn-out women
with hollow cheeks and staring eyes, and children with dusty, tear-streaked
faces crowded and filled the road.</p>

<p>The rear-guard passed numbers of these lying utterly exhausted
by the roadside, and the road for miles was strewn with the wreckage
of the retreat, with men who had fallen out unable longer to march
on blistered or bleeding feet or collapsed in the heedless sleep of
complete exhaustion; with broken-down carts dragged clear into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</span>
the roadside and spilled with their jumbled contents into the ditch;
with crippled horses and footsore cattle; with quivering-lipped,
grey-haired old men, and dry-eyed, cowering women, and frightened,
clinging children. Some of these peasantry roused themselves as
the last of the rear-guard regiments came up with them, struggled
again to follow on the road, or dragged themselves clear of it and
sought refuge and hiding in abandoned cottages or barns or the
deep dry ditches.</p>

<p>At one point where the road crept up the long slope of a hill the
rear-guard came under the longe-range fire of the German guns.
The shells came roaring down, to burst in clouds of belching black
smoke in the fields to either side of the road, or to explode with a
sharp tearing cr-r-rash in the air, their splinters and bullets raining
down out of the thick white woolly smoke cloud that coiled and
writhed and unfolded in slow heavy oily eddies.</p>

<p>One battalion of the rear-guard was halted at the foot of the hill
and spread out off the road and across the line of it. Again they
were told not to lie down, and for the most part the men obeyed,
leaning heavily with their arms folded on the muzzles of their rifles
or watching the regiments crawling slowly up the road with the coal-black
shell-bursts in the fields about them or the white air-bursts
of the shrapnel above them.</p>

<p>‘Pretty bloomin’ sight—I don’t think,’ growled a gaunt and
weary-eyed private. The man next him laughed shortly. ‘Pretty
one for the Germs, anyway,’ he said; ‘and one they’re seein’ a sight
too often for my fancy. They’ll be forgettin’ wot our faces look
like if we keep on at this everlastin’ runnin’ away.’</p>

<p>‘Blast ’em,’ said the first speaker savagely, ‘but our turn will
come presently. D’you think this yarn is right, Jacko, that we’re
retirin’ this way just to draw ’em away from their base?’</p>

<p>‘Gawd knows,’ said Jacko; ‘but they didn’t bring us over ’ere
to do nothin’ but run away, an’ you can bet on that, Peter.’</p>

<p>An order passed down the line, and the men began to move slowly
into the road again and to shake into some sort of formation on it,
and then to plod off up the hill in the wake of the rest. The shells
were still plastering the hillside and crashing over the road, and
several men were hit as the battalion tramped wearily up the hill.
Even the shells failed to rouse most of the men from their apathy
and weariness, but those it did stir it roused mainly to angry resentment
or sullen oath-mumblings and curses.</p>

<p>‘Well, Jacko,’ said Peter bitterly, ‘I’ve knowed I had a fair<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</span>
chance o’ bein’ shot, but burn me if ever I thought I was goin’ to
be shot in the back.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a long way to Tipperary,’ said Jacko, ‘an’ there’s bound
to be a turnin’ in it somewheres.’</p>

<p>‘An’ it’s a longer way to Berlin if we keeps on marchin’ like this
with our backs to it,’ grumbled Peter.</p>

<p>The sound of another approaching shell rose from a faint moan
to a loud shriek, to a roar, to a wild torrent of yelling, whooping,
rush-of-an-express-train, whirlwind noise; and then, just when it
seemed to each man that the shell was about to fall directly on his
own individual head, it burst with a harsh crash over them, and a
storm of bullets and fragments whistled and hummed down, hitting
the fields’ soft ground with deep <em>whutts</em>, clashing sharply on the
harder road. A young officer jerked out a cry, stumbled blindly
forward a few paces with outstretched arms, pitched, and fell heavily
on his face. He was close to where Peter and Jacko marched, and
the two shambled hastily together to where he lay, lifted and turned
him over. Neither needed a second look. ‘Done in,’ said Peter
briefly, and ‘Never knew wot hit ’im,’ agreed Jacko.</p>

<p>An officer ran back to them, followed slowly and heavily by
another. There was no question as to what should be done with
the lad’s body. He had to be left there, and the utmost they could
do for him was to lift and carry him—four dog-tired men hardly
able to lift their feet and carry their own bodies—to a cottage by
the roadside, and bring him into an empty room with a litter of
clothes and papers spilled about the floor from the tumbled drawers,
and lay him on a dishevelled bed and spread a crumpled sheet over
him.</p>

<p>‘Let’s hope they’ll bury him decently,’ said one of the officers.
The other was pocketing the watch and few pitiful trinkets he had
taken from the lad’s pockets. ‘Hope so,’ he said dully. ‘Not that
it matters much to poor old Dicky. Come on, we must move, or
I’ll never be able to catch the others up.’</p>

<p>They left the empty house quietly, pulling the door gently shut
behind them.</p>

<p>‘Pore little Blinker,’ said Jacko as they trudged up the
road after the battalion; ‘the best bloomin’ officer the platoon
ever ’ad.’</p>

<p>‘The best I ever ’ad in all my seven,’ said Peter. ‘I ain’t forgettin’
the way ’e stood up for me afore the C.O. at Aldershot
when I was carpeted for drunk. And ’im tryin’ to stand wi’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</span>
the right side of ’is face turned away from the light, so the C.O.
wouldn’t spot the black eye I gave ’im in that same drunk!’</p>

<p>‘Ah, an’ that was just like ’im,’ said Jacko. ‘An’ to think
’e’s washed out with a ’ole in the back of his ’ead—the back of it,
mind you.’</p>

<p>Peter cursed sourly.</p>

<p>The battalion trailed wearily on until noon, halted then, and
for the greater part flung themselves down and slept on the roadside
for the two hours they waited there; were roused—as many
of them, that is, as would rouse, for many, having stopped the
machine-like motion of marching, could not recommence it, and
had to be left there—and plodded on again through the baking
afternoon heat. They had marched over thirty miles that day
when at last they trailed into a small town where they were told
they were to be billeted for the night. Other troops, almost as
worn as themselves, were to take over the duties of rear-guard
next day, but although that was good enough news it was nothing
to the fact that to-night, now, the battalion was to halt and lie
down and take their fill—if the Huns let them—of sleep.</p>

<p>They were halted in the main square and waited there for what
seemed to the tired men an interminable time.</p>

<p>‘Findin’ billets,’ said Jacko. ‘Wish they’d hurry up about it.’</p>

<p>‘Seems to me there’s something more than billets in the wind,’
said Peter suspiciously. ‘Wot’s all the officers confabbin’ about, an’
wot’s that <em>tamasha</em> over there wi’ them Staff officers an’ the C.O.?’</p>

<p>The <em>tamasha</em> broke up, and the C.O. tramped back to the group
of his officers, and after a short parley they saluted him and walked
over to the battalion.</p>

<p>‘Fall in,’ came the order sharply. ‘Fall in there, fall in.’</p>

<p>Most of the men were sitting along the curb of the pavement
or in the dusty road, or standing leaning on their rifles. They
rose and moved heavily and stiffly, and shuffled into line.</p>

<p>‘Wot is it, sergeant?’ asked Jacko suspiciously. ‘Wot’s the move?’</p>

<p>‘We’re goin’ back,’ said the sergeant. ‘Hurry up there, you.
Fall in. We’re goin’ back, an’ there’s some word of a fight.’</p>

<p>The word flew round the ranks. ‘Going back ... a fight
... back....’</p>

<p>Across the square another regiment tramped stolidly and
turned down a side street. A man in their rear ranks turned and
waved a hand to the waiting battalion. ‘So long, chums,’ he
called. ‘See you in Berlin.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</span>
‘Ga’ strewth,’ said Jacko, and drew a deep breath. ‘Goin’
back; an’ a fight; an’ the ol’ Buffs on the move too. In Berlin,
eh; wonder wot they’ve ’eard. Back—blimey, Peter, I believe
we’re goin’ for the blinkin’ ’Uns again. I believe we’re goin’ to
advance.’</p>

<p>That word went round even faster than the other, and where
it passed it left behind it a stir of excitement, a straightening of
rounded shoulders, a lifting of lolling heads. ‘Going back ...
going to attack this time ... going to advance....’</p>

<p>Actually this was untrue, or partly so at least. They were
going back, but still merely acting as rear-guard to take up a position
clear of the town and hold it against the threat of too close-pressing
pursuit. But the men knew nothing of that at the time. They
were going back; there was word of a fight; what else did that
spell but a finish to this cursed running away, an advance instead
of a retreat? The rumour acted like strong wine to the men. They
moved to the parade orders with something of their old drilled and
disciplined appearance; they swung off in their fours with shuffling
steps, it is true, but with a decent attempt to keep the step, with
their heads more or less erect and their shoulders back. And when
the head of the column turned off the square back into the same
street they had come up into the town, a buzz of talk and calling
ran through the ranks, a voice piped up shakily ‘It’s a Long Way
to Tipperary’ and a dozen, a score, a hundred voices took up the
chorus sturdily and defiantly. The battalion moved out with the
narrow streets ringing to their steady tramp, tramp, over the <i lang="fr">pavé</i>
cobbles and the sound of their singing. Once clear of the town, it is
true, the singing died away and the regular tramping march tailed
off into the murmuring shuffle of feet moving out of step. But the
deadly apathy had lifted from the men, there was an air of new life
about them; one would never have known this battalion for the
one that had marched in over the same road half an hour before.
Then they were no more than a broken, dispirited crowd, their minds
dazed, their bodies numbed with fatigue, moving mechanically,
dully, apathetically, still plodding and shuffling their feet forward
merely because their conscious minds had set their limbs the task,
and then the tired brains, run down, had left the machinery of their
bodies still working—working jerkily and slackly perhaps, but
nevertheless working as it would continue to work until the overstrained
muscles refused their mechanical duty.</p>

<p>Now they were a battalion, a knitted and coherent body of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</span>
fighting men, still worn out and fatigued almost to the point of
collapse, but with working minds, with a conscious thought in their
brains, with discipline locking their ranks again, with the prospect
of a fight ahead, with the hope strong in them that the tide was
turning, that they were done with the running away and retreating
and abandoning hard-fought fields they were positive they had
won; that now their turn was come, that here they were commencing
and making the longed-for advance.</p>

<p>And as they marched they heard behind them a deep <em>boo-boom</em>,
<em>boo-boom</em>, <em>boo-moom</em> and the whistling rush of the shells over their
heads. That and the low muttering rumble of guns far out on the
flank brought to them a final touch of satisfaction. They were
advancing, and the guns were supporting them already then—good,
oh good!</p>

<p>And as they marched back down the road they had come they
met some of their stragglers hobbling painfully on bandaged feet,
or picked them up from where they still lay in a stupor of sleep on
the roadside. And to all of them the one word ‘advance’ was
enough. ‘We’re going back ... it’s an advance,’ turned them
staggering round to limp back in the tail of the battalion, or lifted
them to their feet to follow on as best they might. They picked
up more than their own men, too, men of other regiments who had
straggled and fallen out, but now drew fresh store of strength from
the cheerful word ‘advance,’ and would not be denied their chance
to be in the van of it, but tailed on in rear of the battalion and
struggled to keep up with them. ‘We’re all right, sir,’ said one
when an officer would have turned him and sent him back to find
his own battalion. ‘We’re pretty near done in on marching;
but there’s a plenty fight left in us—specially when it’s an advance.’</p>

<p>‘Jacko,’ said Peter, ‘I’m damn near dead; but thank the Lord
I won’t ’ave to die runnin’ away.’</p>

<p>‘All I asks,’ said Jacko, ‘is as fair a target on ’em as we’ve ’ad
before, an’ a chance to put a ’ole in the back o’ some o’ <em>their</em> ’eads.’</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ said Peter. ‘Pore little Blinker. They’ve got to pay
for ’im an’ a few more like ’im.’</p>

<p>‘They ’ave, blarst them,’ said Jacko savagely, and dropped his
hand to his bayonet haft, slid the steel half out and home again.
‘Don’t fret, chum, they’ll pay—soon or late, this time or nex’, one
day or another—they’ll pay.’</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>THE LOST NAVAL PAPERS.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center">BY BENNET COPPLESTONE.<br>
<br>
<abbr title="One">I.</abbr>
<br>
<span class="allsmcap">BAITING THE TRAP</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> story—which contains a moral for those fearful folk who
exalt everything German—was told to me by Richard Cary, the
accomplished naval correspondent of a big paper in the North of
England. I have known him and his enthusiasm for the White
Ensign for twenty years. He springs from an old naval stock,
the Carys of North Devon, and has devoted his life to the study of
the Sea Service. He had for so long been accustomed to move
freely among shipyards and navymen, and was trusted so completely,
that the veil of secrecy which dropped in August 1914
between the Fleets and the world scarcely existed for him. Everything
which he desired to know for the better understanding of the
real work of the Navy came to him officially or unofficially. When,
therefore, he states that the Naval Notes with which this story
deals would have been of incalculable value to the enemy, I accept
his word without hesitation. I have myself seen some of them
and they made me tremble—for Cary’s neck. I pressed him to
write this story himself, but he refused. ‘No,’ said he, ‘I have
told you the yarn just as it happened; write it yourself. I am
a dull dog, quite efficient at handling hard facts and making
scientific deductions from them, but with no eye for the picturesque
details. I give it to you.’ He rose to go—Cary had been lunching
with me—but paused for an instant upon my front doorstep. ‘If
you insist upon it,’ added he, smiling, ‘I don’t mind sharing in
the plunder.’</p>

<p class="p2">It was in the latter part of May 1916. Cary was hard at work
one morning in his rooms in the Northern City where he had established
his headquarters. His study table was littered with papers—notes,
diagrams, and newspaper cuttings—and he was laboriously
reducing the apparent chaos into an orderly series of chapters upon
the Navy’s Work which he proposed to publish after the war was
over. It was not designed to be an exciting book—Cary has no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</span>
dramatic instinct—but it would be full of fine sound stuff, close
accurate detail, and clear analysis. Day by day for more than
twenty months he had been collecting details of every phase of
the Navy’s operations, here a little and there a little. He had
recently returned from a confidential tour of the shipyards and
naval bases, and had exercised his trained eye upon checking and
amplifying what he had previously learned. While his recollection
of this tour was fresh he was actively writing up his Notes and
revising the rough early draft of his book. More than once it had
occurred to him that his accumulations of Notes were dangerous
explosives to store in a private house. They were becoming so
full and so accurate that the enemy would have paid any sum or
have committed any crime to secure possession of them. Cary
is not nervous or imaginative—have I not said that he springs from
a naval stock?—but even he now and then felt anxious. He would,
I believe, have slept peacefully though knowing that a delicately
primed bomb lay beneath his bed, for personal risks troubled him
little, but the thought that hurt to his country might come from
his well-meant labours sometimes rapped against his nerves. A few
days before his patriotic conscience had been stabbed by no less
a personage than Admiral Jellicoe, who, speaking to a group of
naval students which included Cary, had said: ‘We have concealed
nothing from you, for we trust absolutely to your discretion.
Remember what you have seen, but do not make any notes.’ Yet
here at this moment was Cary disregarding the orders of a Commander-in-Chief
whom he worshipped. He tried to square his
conscience by reflecting that no more than three people knew of
the existence of his Notes or of the book which he was writing from
them, and that each one of those three was as trustworthy as
himself. So he went on collating, comparing, writing, and the
heap upon his table grew bigger under his hands.</p>

<p>The clock had just struck twelve upon that morning when a
servant entered and said ‘A gentleman to see you, sir, upon
important business. His name is Mr. Dawson.’</p>

<p>Cary jumped up and went to his dining-room, where the visitor
was waiting. The name had meant nothing to him, but the instant
his eyes fell upon Mr. Dawson he remembered that he was the
chief Scotland Yard officer who had come north to teach the local
police how to keep track of the German agents who infested the
shipbuilding centres. Cary had met Dawson more than once and
had assisted him with his intimate local knowledge. He greeted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</span>
his visitor with smiling courtesy, but Dawson did not smile.
His first words, indeed, came like shots from an automatic
pistol.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Cary,’ said he, ‘I want to see your Naval Notes.’</p>

<p>Cary was staggered, for the three people whom I have mentioned
did not include Mr. Dawson. ‘Certainly,’ said he, ‘I will show
them to you if you ask officially. But how in the world did you
hear anything about them?’</p>

<p>‘I am afraid that a good many people know about them, most
undesirable people, too. If you will show them to me—I am asking
officially—I will tell you what I know.’</p>

<p>Cary led the way to his study. Dawson glanced round the
room, at the papers heaped upon the table, at the tall windows
bare of curtains—Cary, who loved light and sunshine, hated
curtains—and growled. Then he locked the door, pulled down the
thick blue blinds required by the East Coast lighting orders, and
switched on the electric lights though it was high noon in May.
‘That’s better,’ said he. ‘You are an absolutely trustworthy man,
Mr. Cary. I know all about you. But you are damned careless.
That bare window is overlooked from half a dozen flats. You
might as well do your work in the street.’</p>

<p>Dawson picked up some of the papers, and their purport was
explained to him by Cary. ‘I don’t know anything of naval
details,’ said he, ‘but I don’t need any evidence of the value of
the stuff here. The enemy wants it, wants it badly; that is good
enough for me.’</p>

<p>‘But,’ remonstrated Cary, ‘no one knows of these papers, or of
the use to which I am putting them, except my son in the Navy,
my wife (who has not read a line of them), and my publisher in
London.’</p>

<p>‘Hum!’ commented Dawson. ‘Then how do you account for
this?’</p>

<p>He opened his leather despatch-case and drew forth a parcel
carefully wrapped up in brown paper. Within the wrapping was
a large white envelope of the linen woven paper used for registered
letters, and generously sealed. To Cary’s surprise, for the envelope
appeared to be secure, Dawson cautiously opened it so as not to
break the seal which was adhering to the flap and drew out a second
smaller envelope, also sealed. This he opened in the same delicate
way and took out a third; from the third he drew a fourth, and so
on until eleven empty envelopes had been added to the litter piled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</span>
upon Cary’s table, and the twelfth, a small one, remained in
Dawson’s hands.</p>

<p>‘Did you ever see anything so childish?’ observed he, indicating
the envelopes. ‘A big, registered, sealed Chinese puzzle like that is
just crying out to be opened. We would have seen the inside of
that one even if it had been addressed to the Lord Mayor, and not
to—well, someone in whom we are deeply interested, though he
does not know it.’</p>

<p>Cary, who had been fascinated by the succession of sealed
envelopes, stretched out his hand towards one of them. ‘Don’t
touch,’ snapped out Dawson. ‘Your clumsy hands would break
the seals, and then there would be the devil to pay. Of course all
these envelopes were first opened in my office. It takes a dozen
years to train men to open sealed envelopes so that neither flap nor
seal is broken, and both can be again secured without showing a
sign of disturbance. It is a trade secret.’</p>

<p>Dawson’s expert fingers then opened the twelfth envelope and
he produced a letter. ‘Now, Mr. Cary, if we had not known you
and also known that you were absolutely honest and loyal—though
dangerously simple-minded and careless in the matter of
windows—this letter would have been very awkward indeed for
you. It runs: “Hagan arrives 10.30 <span class="allsmcap">P.M.</span> Wednesday to get
Cary’s Naval Notes. Meet him. Urgent.” Had we not known
you, Mr. Richard Cary might have been asked to explain how
Hagan knew all about his Naval Notes and was so very confident
of being able to get them.’</p>

<p>Cary smiled. ‘I have often felt,’ said he, ‘especially in war-time,
that it was most useful to be well known to the police. You may
ask me anything you like and I will do my best to answer. I confess
that I am aghast at the searchlight of inquiry which has suddenly
been turned upon my humble labours. My son at sea knows
nothing of the Notes except what I have told him in my letters,
my wife has not read a line of them, and my publisher is the last
man to talk. I seem to have suddenly dropped into the middle
of a detective story.’ The poor man scratched his head and
smiled ruefully at the Scotland Yard officer.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Cary,’ said Dawson, ‘those windows of yours would
account for anything. You have been watched for a long time,
and I am perfectly sure that our friend Hagan and his associates
here know precisely in what drawer of that desk you keep your
naval papers. Your flat is easy to enter—I had a look round<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</span>
before coming in to-day—and on Wednesday night (that is to-morrow)
there will be a scientific burglary here and your Notes
will be stolen.’</p>

<p>‘Oh no they won’t,’ cried Cary. ‘I will take them down this
afternoon to my office and lock them up in the big safe. It will
put me to a lot of bother, for I shall also have to lock up there the
chapters of my book.’</p>

<p>‘You newspaper men ought all to be locked up yourselves.
You are a cursed nuisance to honest, hard-worked Scotland Yard
men like me. But you mistake the object of my visit. I want this
flat to be entered to-morrow night, and I want your naval papers
to be stolen.’</p>

<p>For a moment the wild thought came to Cary that this man
Dawson—the chosen of the Yard—was himself a German Secret
Service agent, and must have shown in his eyes some signs of the
suspicion, for Dawson laughed loudly. ‘No, Mr. Cary, I am not
in the Kaiser’s pay, nor are you, though the case against you might
be painted pretty black. This man Hagan is on our string in
London and we want him very badly indeed. Not to arrest—at
least not just yet—but to keep running round showing us his
pals and all their little games. He is an Irish American, a very
unbenevolent neutral, to whom we want to give a nice, easy, happy
time, so that he can mix himself up thoroughly with the spy business
and wrap a rope many times round his neck. We will pull on to
the end when we have finished with him, but not a minute too soon.
He is too precious to be frightened. Did you ever come across such
an ass’—Dawson contemptuously indicated the pile of sealed
envelopes—‘he must have soaked himself in American dime
novels and cinema crime films. He will be of more use to us than
a dozen of our best officers. I feel that I love Hagan and won’t
have him disturbed. When he comes here to-morrow night he
shall be seen but not heard. He shall enter this room, lift your
Notes, which shall be in their usual drawer, and shall take them
safely away. After that I rather fancy that we shall enjoy ourselves,
and that the salt will stick very firmly upon Hagan’s little
tail.’</p>

<p>Cary did not at all like this plan; it might offer amusement and
instruction to the police, but seemed to involve himself in an
excessive amount of responsibility. ‘Will it not be far too risky
to let him take my Notes even if you do shadow him closely afterwards?
He will get them copied and scattered amongst a score of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</span>
agents, one of whom may get the information through to Germany.
You know your job, of course, but the risk seems too big for me.
After all, they are my Notes, and I would far sooner burn them now
than that the Germans should see a line of them.’</p>

<p>Dawson laughed again. ‘You are a dear simple soul, Mr. Cary;
it does one good to meet you. Why on earth do you suppose
I came here to-day if it were not to enlist your help? Hagan
is going to take all the risks; you and I are not looking for any.
He is going to steal some Naval Notes, but they will not be those
which lie on this table. I myself will take charge of those and
of the chapters of your most reprehensible book. You shall
prepare, right now, a beautiful new artistic set of notes calculated
to deceive. They must be accurate where any errors would be
spotted, but wickedly false wherever deception would be good
for Fritz’s health. I want you to get down to a real plant. This
letter shall be sealed up again in its twelve silly envelopes and
go by registered post to Hagan’s correspondent. You shall have
till to-morrow morning to invent all those things which we want
Fritz to believe about the Navy. Make us out to be as rotten as
you plausibly can. Give him some heavy losses to gloat over
and to tempt him out of harbour. Don’t overdo it, but mix up
your fiction with enough facts to keep it sweet and make it sound
convincing. If you do your work well—and the Naval authorities
here seem to think a lot of you—Hagan will believe in your Notes,
and will try to get them to his German friends at any cost or risk,
which will be exactly what we want of him. Then, when he has
served our purpose, he will find that we—have—no—more—use—for—him.’</p>

<p>Dawson accompanied this slow, harmlessly sounding sentence
with a grim and nasty smile. Cary, before whose eyes flashed
for a moment the vision of a chill dawn, cold grey walls, and a
silent firing party, shuddered. It was a dirty task to lay so subtle
a trap even for a dirty Irish-American spy. His honest English
soul revolted at the call upon his brains and knowledge, but common
sense told him that in this way, Dawson’s way, he could do his
country a very real service. For a few minutes he mused over the
task set to his hand, and then spoke.</p>

<p>‘All right. I think that I can put up exactly what you want.
The faked Notes shall be ready when you come to-morrow. I
will give the whole day to them.’</p>

<p>In the morning the new set of Naval Papers was ready, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</span>
their purport was explained in detail to Dawson, who chuckled
joyously. ‘This is exactly what Admiral —— wants, and it shall
get through to Germany by Fritz’s own channels. I have misjudged
you, Mr. Cary; I thought you little better than a fool, but
that story here of a collision in a fog and the list of damaged
Queen Elizabeths in dock would have taken in even me. Fritz
will suck it down like cream. I like that effort even better than
your grave comments on damaged turbines and worn-out gun
tubes. You are a genius, Mr. Cary, and I must take you to lunch
with the Admiral this very day. You can explain the plant better
than I can, and he is dying to hear all about it. Oh, by the way,
he particularly wants a description of the failure to complete the
latest batch of big shell fuses, and the shortage of lyddite. You
might get that done before the evening. Now for the burglary.
Do nothing, nothing at all, outside your usual routine. Come home
at your usual hour, go to bed as usual, and sleep soundly if you
can. Should you hear any noise in the night put your head under
the bedclothes. Say nothing to Mrs. Cary unless you are obliged,
and for God’s sake don’t let any woman—wife, daughter, or maidservant—disturb
my pearl of a burglar while he is at work. He
must have a clear run, with everything exactly as he expects to
find it. Can I depend upon you?’</p>

<p>‘I don’t pretend to like the business,’ said Cary, ‘but you can
depend upon me to the letter of my orders.’</p>

<p>‘Good,’ cried Dawson. ‘That is all I want.’</p>

<p class="p2 center"><abbr title="Two">II.</abbr><br>
<span class="allsmcap">THE TRAP CLOSES</span>.</p>

<p>Cary heard no noise though he lay awake for most of the night,
listening intently. The flat seemed to be more quiet even than
usual. There was little traffic in the street below, and hardly
a step broke the long silence of the night. Early in the morning—at
six B.S.T.—Cary slipped out of bed, stole down to his study,
and pulled open the deep drawer in which he had placed the bundle
of faked Naval Notes. They had gone! So the Spy-Burglar had
come, and, carefully shepherded by Dawson’s sleuth-hounds, had
found the primrose path easy for his crime. To Cary, the simple,
honest gentleman, the whole plot seemed to be utterly revolting—justified,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</span>
of course, by the country’s needs in time of war, but none
the less revolting. There is nothing of glamour in the Secret
Service, nothing of romance, little even of excitement. It is a cold-blooded
exercise of wits against wits, of spies against spies. The
amateur plays a fish upon a line and gives him a fair run for his
life, but the professional fisherman—to whom a salmon is a people’s
food—nets him coldly and expeditiously as he comes in from the
sea.</p>

<p>Shortly after breakfast there came a call from Dawson on the
telephone. ‘All goes well. Come to my office as soon as possible.’
Cary found Dawson bubbling with professional satisfaction. ‘It
was beautiful,’ cried he. ‘Hagan was met at the train, taken to
a place we know of, and shadowed by us tight as wax. We now
know all his associates—the swine have not even the excuse of
being German. He burgled your flat himself while one of his gang
watched outside. Never mind where I was; you would be surprised
if I told you; but I saw everything. He has the faked papers, is
busy making copies, and this afternoon is going down the river in
a steamer to get a glimpse of the shipyards and docks and check
your Notes as far as can be done. Will they stand all right?’</p>

<p>‘Quite all right,’ said Cary. ‘The obvious things were given
correctly.’</p>

<p>‘Good. We will be in the steamer.’</p>

<p>Cary went that afternoon, quite unchanged in appearance by
Dawson’s order. ‘If you try to disguise yourself,’ declared that
expert, ‘you will be spotted at once. Leave the refinements to
us.’ Dawson himself went as an elderly dug-out officer with the
rank marks of a colonel, and never spoke a word to Cary upon the
whole trip down and up the teeming river. Dawson’s men were
scattered here and there—one a passenger of inquiring mind,
another a deckhand, yet a third—a pretty girl in khaki—sold tea
and cakes in the vessel’s saloon. Hagan—who, Cary heard afterwards,
wore the brass-bound cap and blue kit of a mate in the
American merchant service—was never out of sight for an instant
of Dawson or of one of his troupe. He busied himself with a strong
pair of marine glasses and now and then asked innocent questions
of the ship’s deckhands. He had evidently himself once served as
a sailor. One deckhand, an idle fellow to whom Hagan was very
civil, told his questioner quite a lot of interesting details about the
Navy ships, great and small, which could be seen upon the building
slips. All these details tallied strangely with those recorded in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</span>
Cary’s Notes. The trip up and down the river was a great success
for Hagan and for Dawson, but for Cary it was rather a bore. He
felt somehow out of the picture. In the evening Dawson called
at Cary’s office and broke in upon him. ‘We had a splendid trip
to-day,’ said he. ‘It exceeded my utmost hopes. Hagan thinks
no end of your Notes, but he is not taking any risks. He leaves in
the morning for Glasgow to do the Clyde and to check some more
of your stuff. Would you like to come?’ Cary remarked that he
was rather busy, and that these river excursions, though doubtless
great fun for Dawson, were rather poor sport for himself. Dawson
laughed joyously—he was a cheerful soul when he had a spy upon
his string. ‘Come along,’ said he. ‘See the thing through. I
should like you to be in at the death.’ Cary observed that he had
no stomach for cold damp dawns, and firing parties.</p>

<p>‘I did not quite mean that,’ replied Dawson. ‘Those closing
ceremonies are still strictly private. But you should see the
chase through to a finish. You are a newspaper man and should
be eager for new experiences.’</p>

<p>‘I will come,’ said Cary, rather reluctantly. ‘But I warn you
that my sympathies are steadily going over to Hagan. The poor
devil does not look to have a dog’s chance against you.’</p>

<p>‘He hasn’t,’ said Dawson with great satisfaction.</p>

<p>Cary, to whom the wonderful Clyde was as familiar as the river
near his own home, found the second trip almost as wearisome
as the first. But not quite. He was now able to recognise Hagan,
who again appeared as a brass-bounder, and did not affect to
conceal his deep interest in the Naval panorama offered by the
river. Nothing of real importance can, of course, be learned
from a casual steamer trip, but Hagan seemed to think otherwise,
for he was always either watching through his glasses or asking
apparently artless questions of passengers or passing deckhands.
Again a sailor seemed disposed to be communicative; he pointed
out more than one monster in steel, red raw with surface rust,
and gave particulars of a completed power which would have
surprised the Admiralty Superintendent. They would not, however,
have surprised Mr. Cary, in whose ingenious brain they had been
conceived. This second trip, like the first, was declared by Dawson
to have been a great success. ‘Did you know me?’ he asked.
‘I was a clean-shaven Naval doctor, about as unlike the Army
colonel of the first trip as a pigeon is unlike a gamecock. Hagan
is off to London to-night by the North-Western. There are three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</span>
copies of your Notes. One is going by Edinburgh and the east
coast, and another by the Midland. Hagan has the original masterpiece.
I will look after him and leave the two other messengers
to my men. I have been on to the Yard by ’phone and have
arranged that all three shall have passports for Holland. The
two copies shall reach the Kaiser, bless him, but I really must
have Hagan’s set of Notes for my Museum.’</p>

<p>‘And what will become of Hagan?’ asked Cary.</p>

<p>‘Come and see,’ said Mr. Dawson.</p>

<p>Dawson entertained Cary at dinner in a private room at the
Station Hotel, waited upon by one of his own confidential men.
‘Nobody ever sees me,’ he observed with much satisfaction, ‘though
I am everywhere.’ (I suspect that Dawson is not without his
little vanities.) ‘Except in my office and with people whom
I know well, I am always someone else. The first time I came to
your house I wore a beard, and the second time looked like a gas
inspector. You saw only the real Dawson. When one has got
the passion for the chase in one’s blood, one cannot bide for long
in a stuffy office. As I have a jewel of an assistant, I can always
escape and follow up my own victims. This man Hagan is a
black heartless devil. Don’t waste your sympathy on him,
Mr. Cary. He took money from us quite lately to betray the
silly asses of Sinn Feiners, and now, thinking us hoodwinked, is
after more money from the Kaiser. He is of the type that
would sell his own mother and buy a mistress with the money.
He’s not worth your pity. We use him and his like for just so
long as they can be useful, and then the jaws of the trap close.
By letting him take those faked Notes we have done a fine
stroke for the Navy, for the Yard, and for Bill Dawson. We
have got into close touch with four new German agents here and
two more down south. We shan’t seize them yet; just keep them
hanging on and use them. That’s the game. I am never anxious
about an agent when I know him and can keep him watched.
Anxious, bless you; I love him like a cat loves a mouse. I’ve had
some spies on my string ever since the war began; I wouldn’t have
them touched or worried for the world. Their correspondence
tells me everything, and if a letter to Holland which they haven’t
written slips in sometimes it’s useful, very useful, as useful almost
as your faked Notes.’</p>

<p>Half an hour before the night train was due to leave for the
South, Dawson, very simply but effectively changed in appearance—for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</span>
Hagan knew by sight the real Dawson,—led Cary to the
middle sleeping-coach on the train. ‘I have had Hagan put in
No. 5,’ he said, ‘and you and I will take Nos. 4 and 6. No. 5 is
an observation berth; there is one fixed up for us on this sleeping-coach.
Come in here.’ He pulled Cary into No. 4, shut the door,
and pointed to a small wooden knob set a few inches below the
luggage rack. ‘If one unscrews that knob one can see into the
next berth, No. 5. No. 6 is fitted in the same way, so that we can
rake No. 5 from both sides. But, mind you, on no account touch
those knobs until the train is moving fast and until you have
switched out the lights. If No. 5 was dark when you opened the
peep-hole, a ray of light from your side would give the show away.
And unless there was a good deal of vibration and rattle in the
train you might be heard. Now cut away to No. 6, fasten the
door, and go to bed. I shall sit up and watch, but there is nothing
for you to do.’</p>

<p>Hagan appeared in due course, was shown into No. 5 berth,
and the train started. Cary asked himself whether he should go
to bed as advised or sit up reading. He decided to obey Dawson’s
orders, but to take a look in upon Hagan before settling down
for the journey. He switched off his lights, climbed upon the
bed, and carefully unscrewed the little knob which was like the
one shown to him by Dawson. A beam of light stabbed the darkness
of his berth, and putting his eye with some difficulty to the
hole—one’s nose gets so confoundedly in the way—he saw Hagan
comfortably arranging himself for the night. The spy had no
suspicion of his watchers on both sides, for, after settling himself
in bed, he unwrapped a flat parcel, and took out a bundle of blue
papers which Cary at once recognised as the originals of his stolen
Notes. Hagan went through them—he had put his suit-case
across his knees to form a desk—and carefully made marginal
jottings. Cary, who had often tried to write in trains, could not
but admire the man’s laborious patience. He painted his letters and
figures over and over again, in order to secure distinctness, in spite
of the swaying of the train, and frequently stopped to suck the
point of his pencil.</p>

<p>‘I suppose,’ thought Cary, ‘that Dawson yonder is just gloating
over his prey, but for my part I feel an utterly contemptible
beast. Never again will I set a trap for even the worst of my
fellow-creatures.’ He put back the knob, went to bed, and passed
half the night in extreme mental discomfort and the other half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</span>
in snatching brief intervals of sleep. It was not a pleasant
journey.</p>

<p>Dawson did not come out of his berth at Euston until after
Hagan had left the station in a taxicab, much to Cary’s surprise,
and then was quite ready, even anxious, to remain for breakfast
at the hotel. He explained his strange conduct. ‘Two of my
men,’ said he, as he wallowed in tea and fried soles—one cannot
get Dover soles in the weary North—‘who travelled in ordinary
compartments, are after Hagan in two taxis, so that if one is delayed
the other will keep touch. Hagan’s driver also has had a police
warning, so that our spy is in a barbed-wire net. I shall hear
before very long all about him.’</p>

<p>Cary and Dawson spent the morning at the hotel with a telephone
beside them; every few minutes the bell would ring, and a whisper
of Hagan’s movements steal over the wires into the ears of the
spider Dawson. He reported progress to Cary with ever-increasing
satisfaction.</p>

<p>‘Hagan has applied for and been granted a passport to
Holland, and has booked a passage in the boat which leaves
Harwich to-night for the Hook. We will go with him. The other
two spies, with the copies, haven’t turned up yet, but they are
all right. My men will see them safe across into Dutch territory,
and make sure that no blundering Customs officer interferes with
their papers. This time the way of transgressors shall be very
soft. As for Hagan, he is not going to arrive.’</p>

<p>‘I don’t quite understand why you carry on so long with him,’
said Cary, who, though tired, could not but feel intense interest in
the perfection of the police system and in the serene confidence of
Dawson. The Yard could, it appeared, do unto the spies precisely
what Dawson chose to direct.</p>

<p>‘Hagan is an American citizen,’ explained Dawson. ‘If he had
been a British subject I would have taken him at Euston—we
have full evidence of the burglary, and of the stolen papers in his
suit-case. But as he is a damned unbenevolent neutral, and the
American Government is very touchy, we must prove his intention
to sell the papers to Germany. Then we can deal with him by
secret court-martial, and President Wilson can go to blazes. The
journey to Holland will prove this intention. Hagan has been
most useful to us in Ireland, and now in the North of England and
in Scotland, but he is too enterprising and too daring to be left
any longer on the string. I will draw the ends together at the Hook.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</span>
‘I did not want to go to Holland,’ said Cary to me, when telling
his story. ‘I was utterly sick and disgusted with the whole cold-blooded
game of cat and mouse, but the police needed my evidence
about the Notes and the burglary, and did not intend to let me
slip out of their clutches. Dawson was very civil and pleasant,
but I was in fact as tightly held upon his string as was the wretched
Hagan. So I went on to Holland with that quick-change artist,
and watched him come on board the steamer at Parkeston Quay,
dressed as a rather German-looking commercial traveller, eager for
war commissions upon smuggled goods. This sounds absurd, but
his get-up seemed somehow to suggest the idea. Then I went
below. Dawson always kept away from me whenever Hagan
might have seen us together.’</p>

<p>The passage across to Holland was free from incident; there
was no sign that we were at war, and Continental traffic was
being carried serenely on, within easy striking distance of the
German submarine base at Zeebrugge. The steamer had drawn
in to the Hook beside the train, and Hagan was approaching the
gangway, suit-case in hand. The man was on the edge of safety;
once upon Dutch soil, Dawson could not have laid hands upon him.
He would have been a neutral citizen in a neutral country, and no
English warrant would run against him. But between Hagan
and the gangway suddenly interposed the tall form of the ship’s
captain; instantly the man was ringed about by officers, and before
he could say a word or move a hand he was gripped hard and led
across the deck to the steamer’s chart-house. Therein sat Dawson,
the real, undisguised Dawson, and beside him sat Richard Cary.
Hagan’s face, which two minutes earlier had been glowing with
triumph and with the anticipation of German gold beyond the
dreams of avarice, went white as chalk. He staggered and gasped
as one stabbed to the heart, and dropped into a chair. His suit-case
fell from his relaxed fingers to the floor.</p>

<p>‘Give him a stiff brandy-and-soda,’ directed Dawson, almost
kindly, and when the victim’s colour had ebbed back a little from
his overcharged heart, and he had drunk deep of the friendly
cordial, the detective put him out of pain. The game of cat and
mouse was over.</p>

<p>‘It is all up, Hagan,’ said the detective gently. ‘Face the
music and make the best of it, my poor friend. This is Mr. Richard
Cary, and you have not for a moment been out of our sight since
you left London for the north four days ago.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</span>
When I had completed the writing of his story I showed the
MS. to Richard Cary, who was pleased to express a general approval.
‘Not at all bad, Copplestone,’ said he, ‘not at all bad. You
have clothed my dry bones in real flesh and blood. But you have
missed what to me is the outstanding feature of the whole affair, that
which justifies to my mind the whole rather grubby business. Let
me give you two dates. On May 25 two copies of my faked Notes
were shepherded through to Holland and reached the Germans;
on May 31 was fought the Battle of Jutland. Can the brief space
between these dates have been merely an accident? I cannot
believe it. No, I prefer to believe that in my humble way I
induced the German Fleet to issue forth and to risk an
action which, under more favourable conditions for us, would
have resulted in their utter destruction. I may be wrong, but I
am happy in retaining my faith.’</p>

<p>‘What became of Hagan?’ I asked, for I wished to bring the
narrative to a clean artistic finish.</p>

<p>‘I am not sure,’ answered Cary, ‘though I gave evidence as
ordered by the court-martial. But I rather think that I have
here Hagan’s epitaph.’ He took out his pocket-book, and drew
forth a slip of paper upon which was gummed a brief newspaper
cutting. This he handed to me, and I read as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot_narrow">
<p class="small">The War Office announces that a prisoner
who was charged with espionage and recently
tried by court-martial at the Westminster
Guildhall was found guilty and sentenced to
death. The sentence was duly confirmed and
carried out yesterday morning.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>THREE GENERATIONS.</i></span></h2>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Out</span> in the quiet paddock, with the mellow brick walls screening
them from the common life in Bushey Park, they are browsing
gently through the last days of their existence. It is not so many
years since, gay with trappings, led by a groom apiece to restrain
their Hanoverian tempers, these old cream-coloured horses drew
the wonderful glass coach through the streets of London, haughtily
accepting for themselves the acclamations of the people. At
how many pageants, could they but tell us, have they not assisted?
Are they old enough to have drawn Queen Victoria to her Diamond
Jubilee, and did they drag that heavy gun-carriage with its
pathetically small burden through the mourning streets on a
Queen’s last journey? Certainly in their own estimation they were
the central figures on the chilly August day when they at last
carried King Edward to Westminster Abbey amid the joyous thanksgiving
of a whole Empire. Their reminiscences would not probably
take them very far into the present reign. It must be some little
time since the next generation callously ousted them from between
the royal shafts, stripped them once for all of their gay trappings,
and set them on a back shelf of history.</p>

<p>So now they browse and slumber among the buttercups, and
perhaps wonder vaguely at their unshorn and generally disordered
condition, and at their prolonged days of idleness. They know
and care nothing about the war. They are aliens who have no
need to be registered, naturalised as they have been by long generations
of royal service. For it is just two hundred years since the
first George, in a spirit of arrogance which, as a race, they appear to
have assimilated, brought their ancestors from Hanover to draw
his royal coach in his adopted country.</p>

<p>They came with those ill-featured ladies who, according to
tradition, gave the name to the <cite>Frog Walk</cite> outside the Palace
walls—yes, <em>outside</em>—and the creams had nothing to do with them.
Never, in the course of their aristocratic history, have they drawn
anything but crowned heads and their most legitimate spouses,
and for this the British nation reveres and respects them. And
now these, their descendants in the paddock, have done with streets
and crowds and uniforms—and even with sovereigns. Sometimes
one old fellow will lift his head at the sound of the children’s cries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</span>
on the swings in the Park, and wonder if he is once more being
cheered by the populace, but his dim eyes can only see the chestnuts
hanging out their red and white candles, and a crow laughs at him
from the wall. By his side his comrades, wholly unmoved, with
hanging heads and slowly switching tails, are busy cropping the
sweet grass, with no thought beyond it. Old age does sometimes,
in spite of evidence to the contrary, broaden and mellow the sympathies,
and the Cream Colours, who have been above all things
exclusive, have developed a very soft spot in their hearts for the
old bay horse who shares their paddock. Possibly he, who, whatever
he has done in private life, in royal processions has never
aspired beyond princesses, knows how to keep his place. At all
events, when a sudden spurt of renewed activity will carry him at
a gallant pace across the paddock, the august Three will follow
him at a feeble canter and with anxious whinnies, until at last,
finding him on the other side, they will happily nuzzle their noses
into his neck, with every sign of equine affection, which he must
accept with mingled pride and resignation. Is he not the <i lang="fr">enfant
gâté de la maison</i>?</p>

<p>Well, their great days are over, but they could have found
no more dignified place of retirement than under the royal shadow
of Hampton Court Palace, the accepted home of retirement and
dignity.</p>

<p>Meantime, out in the road, could they but know it, their successors
on these summer mornings are taking part in a strange,
rather pathetic mimicry of those greater pageants which have no
place in war-time. For the Cream Colours of to-day cannot be
allowed to idle like their parents. Much may yet, we hope, be
expected of them, and they must not forget the manner of that
service to which alone they owe their existence. So in the early
morning, when trams are few and other traffic is non-existent,
they may be met, eight of them, stepping proudly along, with
arched necks and haughty expressions, quite unaware that the
grooms holding to their bridles are in mufti, that their trappings
are of plain wood, and that the royal coach they imagine to be
rumbling behind them resembles nothing so much as an empty
jail van! The King in the fairy tale was not better pleased with
his imaginary fine raiment than the Cream Colours with their
phantom state. But nobody troubles to undeceive them; the
rooks flap cawing overhead in pursuit of their breakfasts, and
the cuckoo monotonously calling from the Home Park is entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</span>
absorbed in his own business. All is vanity, and in another
few years they also will be cropping buttercups, with no higher
aspiration.</p>

<p>For the next generation is already knocking at the door. On
the further side of the road from his forebears, a little dusky foal
who will some day be of a correct highly polished cream colour
is kicking up his heels in a paddock, a truly royal nursery with a
golden floor. He is separated even at this early age from his
black and bay contemporaries, whose lot, however, will certainly
be more varied and interesting than any which he can look for.
Let us hope that he may still be in the nursery when his sleek
elders, now disappearing in their own dust along the road, will draw
their sovereign in state to return thanks for the greatest of all
victories, and the establishment of a righteous peace throughout
the world.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>ARMY UNIFORMS, PAST AND PRESENT.</i></span></h2>
<p class="center">BY THE RT. HON. SIR HERBERT MAXWELL, BT.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">In</span> the early ’seventies of last century there was staged in London
a very amusing musical comedy called <cite>The Happy Land</cite>, the scene
being laid in Paradise. Among the principal characters were
extremely skilful and poignant burlesques of Mr. Gladstone, Prime
Minister at the time, Mr. Lowe, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and
Mr. Ayrton, First Commissioner of Works. The piece had but a
short, though brilliant, run in the metropolis; for the Lord
Chamberlain ordered it off the stage, not on the grounds of what
is usually implied by immorality, but because it brought Her
Majesty’s Ministers into contempt by mordant caricature of their
features and action.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is not known—to me, at least—which of
the three victims set the censorship in motion. Certainly it was
not ‘Bob’ Lowe, who was gifted with a fine strain of humour.
Probably it was done at Mr. Ayrton’s instance, he being destitute
of that saving grace, and, besides, having been more mercilessly
satirised in the play than his colleagues. He had outraged public
feeling, if not public taste, by some acts of his administration as
ædile, notably by painting grey some of the fine stone-work in the
lobbies of the Houses of Parliament. I forget the libretto of <cite>The
Happy Land</cite>; but this much I remember, that, whereas in the first
act the scenery of Paradise appeared glowing with rainbow radiance
and shimmering with gems, in the second act it represented the
effect of Ayrton’s régime—everything had been painted ‘government
grey.’</p>

<p>All this was brought to mind by the change wrought upon the
appearance of the British Army after the outbreak of the South
African war in 1899. By a wave of his wand or a scratch of his
quill the Secretary of State for War, Mr. St. John Brodrick (now
Viscount Midleton) quenched all gaiety of colour in the fighting
dress of our troops; the historic thin red line was to be seen no
more; the glittering squadrons were doomed to ride in raiment
as sombre as the dust of their own raising; henceforward standards
and regimental colours were to be returned to store before the
troops went on active service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</span>
Had that been all, it would have sufficed to mark a notable era
in the operations of war—a wise measure, imposed upon the Army
Council by the vast improvement in the range, trajectory, and
precision of artillery and small arms. Hitherto it had been the
object of the military authorities of all nations to make their fighting
men as conspicuous as possible, exaggerating their stature by
fantastic headgear and setting them in strong relief to every variety
of natural background by means of bright colours and pipeclay.
The Brigade of Guards landed in the Crimea without their knapsacks,
which followed in another ship. The men had to do
without them for some weeks; but the cumbrous bearskin caps
were considered indispensable, and offered a fine target for the
Russian defenders of the slopes of the Alma. The hint was
thrown away upon our military authorities. It required a
sharper lesson to convince them of the cruel absurdity of figging
out men for battle in a dress that hampered the limbs and obscured
the eyesight. The Guards were not more absurdly dressed on that
occasion than the rest of the British troops. The late Sir William
Flower described to me his feelings when, as surgeon of an
infantry regiment, he stepped out from a boat on the wet sands
at the mouth of the Alma, dressed in a skin-tight scarlet coatee with
swallow tails, a high collar enclosing a black stock, close-fitting
trousers tightly strapped over Wellington boots, and a cocked hat!</p>

<p>Two years before that—in 1852—Colonel Luard published his
<cite>History of the Dress of the British Soldier</cite>. Having served as a
heavy dragoon in the Peninsula, as a light dragoon at Waterloo, as
a lancer in India, and as a staff officer both in India and at home,
he had practical experience of the variety of torment inflicted by
different kinds of uniform. He advocated many reforms in the
soldier’s dress, tending as much to increased efficiency as to comfort,
and he supported his argument by extracts from his correspondence
with regimental officers. One of these wrote—‘If an infantry
soldier has to step over a drain two feet broad, he has to put one
hand to his cap to keep it on his head, and his other to his pouch,
and what becomes of his musket?’ And this, be it remembered,
was the fighting-kit; for no general in those days ever dreamed of
taking troops into action except in full review order.</p>

<p>James <abbr title="One">I.</abbr> was not a warlike king, but he was a pretty shrewd
observer of men and matters. He was not far wrong when he
observed that plate armour was a fine thing, for it not only protected
the life of the wearer, but hindered him from hurting anybody else!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</span>
The remark might have been applied with equal justice to the
costume of British soldiers in the Crimean campaign, except that
<a id="chg1"></a>it afforded no protection to the wearer’s life or limb. It required
nearly one hundred years of painful experience to convince the
War Office that it was cruel stupidity to put men in the field in
clothing so tight as to fetter the limbs and compress the chest.
That was the legacy of George IV. to the British Army.</p>

<p>Although, to one looking back over the history of what is now
the United Kingdom, the most salient features seem to be campaigns
and battles, invasion and counter-invasion, it was not until the
Civil War that any attempt was made towards a uniform dress
for any army. It is true that both the English and Scottish Parliaments
from time to time prescribed with the utmost care the
offensive and defensive armour with which every able-bodied
subject was to provide himself or be provided by his feudal chief,
and if that chief were a wealthy baron his following would be
clothed in his liveries. Thus, in describing the famous scene at
Lauder when Archibald Douglas, fifth Earl of Angus, won his
sobriquet of Bell-the-Cat, Pitscottie tells us in deliciously quaint
phrase how luckless Thomas Cochrane, newly created Earl of
Mar, rode down to the kirk where the disaffected lords were in
conference, at the head of three hundred men all dressed in his
liveries of white doublets with black bands. Cromwell was the
first ruler of England who succeeded in what several of his
predecessors had failed—in maintaining a standing army. At one
time he had 80,000 men under arms. There was a degree of
uniformity in the dress of his cavalry and infantry. It consisted
mainly of buff coats, with the addition of breast and
back pieces, iron caps, and other defensive armour. But that
army was disbanded after the Restoration, and it was not until
the reign of William III. that a standing army was finally constituted,
and colonels commanding regiments, being allowed a
sufficient sum for clothing the men, were required to do so according
to sealed pattern.</p>

<p>Throughout the eighteenth century, the British soldier’s dress
was, on the whole, both picturesque and comfortable. In cut, it
conformed pretty faithfully to the fashion prevailing in civilian
attire, though there occurred an interval when George II. inflicted
upon his Guards regiments the preposterous conical head-dress,
copied from the Prussian Guards of Frederick the Great. This
disfiguring headgear did not last very long, and gave place before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</span>
the end of the century to the three-cocked hat of the style called,
I believe, Nivernois or Kevenhüller.</p>

<p>The easy grace of the full-dress uniform of an officer of the Guards
towards the close of the eighteenth century is admirably shown in
Romney’s portrait of John, tenth Earl of Westmorland, now at
Osterley Park. It shows a long-skirted scarlet frock, lined with
white, faced with blue, with ruffles at the wrists, and without any
ornament save a pair of gilt epaulets of moderate size and soft
material, very different from the cumbrous, unyielding things now
prescribed for naval officers and lords-lieutenant. The frock is
worn open over a Ramillies cravat and waistcoat and breeches
of white kersey. It would be difficult to devise a dress for a soldier
so well combining comfort and dignified distinction. To one feature
only can objection be taken. The powdered and curled hair,
clubbed in a pigtail, looks charming on Romney’s canvas, but must
have proved an intolerable nuisance both to officers and men.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p2">‘During the command of the late Duke of Kent at Gibraltar
[1802-3], when a field-day was ordered, there not being sufficient
barbers in the town to attend to all the officers in the morning, the
seniors claimed the privilege of their rank; the juniors consequently
were obliged to have their heads dressed the night before; and to
preserve the beauty of this artistic arrangement—pomatumed,
powdered, curled and clubbed—these poor fellows were obliged to
sleep on their faces! It is said that in the adjutant’s office of each
regiment there was kept a pattern of the correct curls, to which
the barbers could refer.’<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The men wore tunics of a cut similar to those of the officers, but
of coarser cloth. They were buttoned up on duty, the skirts being
looped back. It was a thoroughly sensible and workmanlike
dress, giving perfect freedom to breathing and circulation, together
with protection to loins and thighs. The Chelsea pensioners wear
a coat of the old infantry pattern to this day.</p>

<p>With the Regency came a vicious change. The Prince Regent
paid incessant attention to dress—both to his own and that of
others. He was proud of his figure, which, indeed, was a fine one
till it was ruined by excess, and he loved to display it in closely
fitting dress. Nor was he content until he got his father’s army
buttoned up to the limit of endurance and disfigured by headgear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</span>
of appalling dimensions. The easy open collar and Ramillies tie
were replaced by an upright fence of buckram and a leather stock.
It would be hardly credible, were there not abundant evidence in
the correspondence of the Horse Guards to prove it, that while
Wellington was absorbed in manœuvring against immensely
superior forces in Spain, he had to give attention to correspondence
about changes in the dress of the army, not with a view to making
it more comfortable and workmanlike, but in order to gratify the
caprice of the Prince Regent. No man ever gave less thought
to niceties of tailoring than Lord Wellington (as he was at that
time). His views are set forth in a letter to the Military Secretary
who had consulted him about the uniform to be prescribed for
those regiments of Light Dragoons which the Prince Regent had
desired the Duke of York (recently reinstated as Commander-in-Chief)
to convert into Hussars.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="quotesig">
‘<span class="smcap">Freneda</span>, <i>6th November, 1811</i>.</p>

<p>‘... There is no subject of which I understand so little [as military
uniforms], and, abstractedly speaking, I think it indifferent how
a soldier is clothed, provided it is in an uniform manner, and that
he is forced to keep himself clean and smart, as a soldier ought to
be. But there is one thing I deprecate, and that is any imitation
of the French in any manner. It is impossible to form an idea of
the inconvenience and injury which result from having anything
like them, either on horseback or on foot.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Lutyens and his piquet
were taken in June because the 3rd Hussars had the same caps
as the French <i lang="fr">Chasseurs-à-cheval</i> and some of their Hussars, and
I was near being taken on September 25 from the same cause. At
a distance or in action colours are nothing; the profile and shape
of a man’s cap, and his general appearance, are what guide us; and
why should we make our people look like the French?... I
only beg that we may be as different as possible from the French
in everything. The narrow tops of our infantry, as opposed to
their broad top caps, are a great advantage to those who are to
look at long lines of posts opposed to each other.’</p>
</div>

<p>Two years later, at the battle of Vitoria, the justice of Wellington’s
views about the soldier’s uniform received apt illustration.
Wellington on that day kept the Light Division and 4th Division
under his immediate command. The 3rd and 7th Divisions, under
Picton and Lord Dalhousie, were to join him in order to complete<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</span>
the centre of the line, but they had difficult ground to traverse,
and were late. The Zadora flowed swift and deep in front of the
French position. A countryman having informed Wellington that
the bridge of Tres Puentes was unguarded, Kempt’s riflemen were
sent forward to seize it, which they did, and went so far up the
heights on the farther side that they were able to establish themselves
in shelter of a crest well in rear of a French advanced post.
There they lay, until Wellington’s line was completed by the
arrival of ‘old Picton, riding at the head of the 3rd Division,
dressed in a blue coat and a round hat, swearing as loudly all the
way as if he wore two cocked ones.’<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> The 7th Division came up
at the same time, and while they were deploying the enemy opened
fire upon them. Kempt immediately drew his riflemen from their
shelter and took the French batteries in flank, thereby enabling
the 3rd Division to cross the bridge of Mendoza without loss. But
the dark uniforms of the Rifles deceived the British on the other
side of the river into the belief that they were French. A battery
opened upon them and continued pounding them with round shot
and shrapnel till the advance of Picton’s Division revealed the
blunder.</p>

<p>Wellington’s warning against copying the uniforms of other
nations received little attention. After 1815, when he was in
command of the Army of Occupation in Paris, it was decided to
arm four regiments of cavalry with lances, a most effective weapon
which had not been carried by British troops since the seventeenth
century. One would have supposed that the lance might be wielded
as effectively by a man dressed as a light dragoon or a hussar as
in any other rig; but the Prince Regent hailed the innovation as
an opportunity for an entirely new costume. Consequently the
9th, 12th, 16th and 23rd Light Dragoons were put into a Polish
dress, modified in such manner as to agree with his Royal Highness’s
sartorial taste.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p2">‘An officer of rank commanding one of the Lancer regiments
was ordered to attend the Prince Regent to fit the new jacket on
him. The tailor, with a pair of scissors, was ordered to cut smooth
every wrinkle and fine-draw the seams. The consequence was
that the coats of the private soldiers, as well as those of the officers,
were made so tight they could hardly get into them; the freedom
of action was so restricted that the infantry with difficulty handled
their muskets, and the cavalry could scarcely do the sword exercise.’</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</span>
The cuirass had been discontinued in the British cavalry since
1794, when it had been found most unsuitable for active service
in the Netherlands. But it was far too showy a piece of goods
to escape the Prince Regent’s attention. Accordingly the three
regiments of Household Cavalry were made to appear at his coronation
in 1820 in steel cuirasses and burnished helmets, with enormous
combs of bearskin; the latter, as Colonel Luard caustically observes,
rendering it impossible for a man to deliver the sixth cut in the
sword exercise of that day. The cuirass and helmet remain, with
the unwieldy jack-boots and leather breeches, an effective, if archaic,
part of a theatrical pageant which Londoners have learnt to love;
but as the equipment of a modern soldier the costume is ludicrously
inapt and very costly. In an era when war has become more
terrible and more intensely destructive than in any previous age,
and at a time when the whole resources of the nation are strained
for the country to hold its own, it may well be asked whether money
might not be more profitably employed than in causing the splendid
men of the Household Cavalry to masquerade in such attire as
would be grotesque to imagine them wearing in modern warfare.</p>

<p>About the same time that the cuirass was inflicted upon the
Household Cavalry, the sentry boxes in London and at Windsor
Castle had to be increased in height in order to accommodate a new
pattern of bearskin cap which had been approved for the Foot
Guards. The old pattern, which had superseded the three-cocked
hat at the end of the previous century, was a sensible affair of
reasonable dimensions; but the army tailors, encouraged by the
new King, were indefatigable in devising extravagance in uniforms,
and the bearskin was made to shoot up several inches in height.
‘Ridicule,’ observed Colonel Luard, ‘subsides when the eye is no
longer a stranger to the object of excitement; otherwise the little
boys would run after the guardsmen when they appear in the
streets of London, and shout at the overwhelming, preposterous,
hideous bearskin caps.’ It is rumoured that the supply of the
right sort of bear is now running short. It may not be too much to
hope that, when our armies return victorious at the end of the war,
the occasion may be marked by the invention of some uniform for
the Brigade of Guards more comfortable and workmanlike than
a skin-tight tunic and a grossly exaggerated fur-cap. Londoners,
laudably conservative in what they have become used with, would
be the less likely to murmur at the change, inasmuch as they have
grown accustomed to see guard-mounting performed in forage-caps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</span>
Among all the variety of uniforms of the British infantry, none
has undergone so little change in the last hundred and fifty years
as that of the Highland regiments. Well that it is so, for there is
none other that so admirably sets off a soldier-like figure, none
that stirs so much enthusiasm among the spectators at a field-day.
So fully has this been recognised that a society has recently been
formed to protest against and endeavour to remedy what is deemed
the unmerited neglect of Lowland Scottish regiments, whereof
the records certainly are no whit inferior in lustre to those of the
Highland corps. It is complained that the Lowland regiments are
always kept in the background; that Edinburgh, though a Lowland
city, is invariably garrisoned by a Highland regiment, and that
facilities for recruiting in Edinburgh and Glasgow are accorded to
Highland regiments and refused to Lowland regiments. Much of
this is unfortunately true; but the real reason for it exists in the
greater popularity of the Highland uniform. No amount of protest
or persuasion will prevail to make the general public take the same
interest in a trousered regiment as in a kilted one. Might not the
surest remedy be to put the Lowland regiments also into kilts?
Purists will object that Lowlanders have no business to don the
philabeg; but, for that matter, neither have they any business to
wear tartan trews, <em>which all the Lowland regiments do at the present
time, besides being furnished with kilted pipers</em>.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Then all Scottish
regiments would be on an equal footing, and no material would
remain for the present irritation. It is difficult to understand,
impossible to explain, the emotion—involuntary, as all true
emotion must be—roused, even in Saisneach breasts, by the sight of
a Highland regiment marching to the skirl of the pipes. In order to
illustrate it, let me lapse for a moment into the first person singular.</p>

<p>During Queen Victoria’s memorable progress through her
metropolis in the Diamond Jubilee of 1897, I was seated with two
ladies of my family in the stand set up for members of Parliament
in Palace Yard. The long hours of waiting on that shining summer
forenoon were enlivened by the march of many regiments, headed
by their bands, passing to their appointed places in the route. It
was a shifting pageant of stirring sight and sound. Presently,
over Westminster Bridge came the Seaforth Highlanders stepping
to the lively strains of <cite>The Muckin’ o’ Geordie’s Byre</cite>.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The effect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</span>
was indescribable—the swing of kilts and sporrans, the dark waving
plumes, the gallant but simple melody, thrilled all spectators. As
for myself, I felt a big lump in my throat, and I was ashamed to
feel something trickle down both cheeks. Yet am I a Lowland
Scot, if anybody is; so far as I am aware, I can lay no claim to any
strain of Celtic blood. If such an one was so deeply moved by the
passing of a single Highland regiment, why should not all the
Scottish regiments be clothed in the romantic garb of Old Gaul,
with the desirable result of rendering the Lowland corps as well-beloved
by the people as the Highlanders? If this were carried
out, it would be esteemed a privilege by the former and a compliment
by the latter. Objection on the score of economy would be
raised because of the cost of the full-dress feather-bonnet, which,
though picturesque, is but a tailor’s parody of the bonnet of the
<i>duine uasail</i>. Let the Lowland regiments be content, then, with
the Glengarry. Nobody who has seen a battalion of the London
Scottish marching through Pall Mall, and listened to the comments
of those who crowd to the club windows at the sound of the pibroch,
will tell you that that fine corps would gain anything in soldierly
appearance by wearing feather-bonnets. That head-dress was
condemned in 1882, but in deference to Queen Victoria’s wishes
it was restored. Its abolition had previously been hotly challenged
in the House of Commons by certain perfervid Scots, one of whom
volunteered a quaint explanation to an honourable member who
had ventured to express some doubt about ostrich feathers being
an appropriate ornament for a Scottish soldier. He gravely assured
the House that the costume had its origin in Sir Ralph Abercromby’s
Egyptian campaign in 1801, when the Highland soldiers picked
up ostrich feathers in the desert and stuck them in their bonnets
as a protection from the sun!</p>

<p>The fact is that the feather-bonnet, and all other exaggerated
and expensive head-dresses, should be as resolutely relegated to
limbo as the hideous masks worn by the fighting men of Old Japan.
Both were designed to overawe the enemy; but, as modern fighting
is done in forage-caps, that naïve purpose cannot be carried into
effect, and the object should be to provide such clothing as will
best enable a man to keep himself, in the Duke of Wellington’s
words, ‘clean and smart, as a soldier ought to be.’ And no headgear
is smarter, none more easily kept clean, than the Glengarry
bonnet.</p>

<p>While it is hardly possible to imagine any dress better calculated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</span>
to impede a soldier’s movements than the uniforms inflicted upon
all arms in the service during the early years of the nineteenth
century, one should not overlook the relief that was ordained in
a detail that was a source of constant unnecessary trouble to the
soldier. Clubbed pigtails had been transmitted as an irksome
legacy from Marlborough’s army, until in 1808 the Horse Guards
decreed their abolition. When Sir Arthur Wellesley landed in
Mondego Bay on August 1-5 in that year, one of his first orders
was that these senseless, dirty appendages were to be cut off.
Never, one may believe, was an order more cheerfully obeyed. A
counter-order was issued shortly after from the Horse Guards,
requiring the retention of pigtails, but it was beyond the power of
man to comply with it. It was easy to cut off pigtails, but
they could not be replaced; and now the only vestige of a barbarous
fashion in the army remains in the bow of black ribbon worn by
the Welsh Fusiliers at the back of the collar of the tunic.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the irrational fashion of tight clothing for the
army instituted by the Prince Regent endures to this day. It
is true that a sensible field-dress of khaki was devised and worn
during the South African War, and is now the service dress of the
army; but the full dress for officers and the ‘walking-out’ uniform
for men is still cut and fitted on the old excruciating lines. I
think it took three weeks to fit a young friend of mine, joining a
battalion of Guards a few years ago, before the adjutant of that
<i lang="fr">corps d’élite</i> passed the tunic as satisfactory. Every crease and
wrinkle had to be obliterated, at such cost to freedom of limbs and
lungs as may be imagined. It may not be an extravagant hope
that, when our army returns once more to a peace footing, the full
dress may be designed with more regard to health and comfort
than hitherto. Our eyes have grown accustomed during the
present war to seeing soldiers in a costume, far from beautiful,
indeed, but easy and respectable. There is no reason why a scarlet
coat should be less comfortable than a dust-coloured one, and it
will be a sad thing if the historic red of the English infantry is not
preserved for full dress. But even if it were not, the khaki uniform
might be rendered very becoming by the addition of a little modest
ornament, especially by the restoration of the old regimental facings.
These would not make troops one whit more conspicuous in the
field; on the contrary, it is a commonplace of optics that parti-coloured
objects are less easily detected in a landscape than those
of one uniform colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</span>
One desirable result of making uniform more comfortable wear
might be expected to follow; officers might not be so scrupulous
to exchange it for mufti the moment they are released from duty.
Alone among the nationalities of Europe has the British officer
hitherto treated his uniform as if it were something to be ashamed
of in private life. It is an unseemly, even an unhandsome practice,
seeing that non-commissioned officers and privates are not allowed
to disport themselves in what they call ‘private clothes.’ Nor
was it the custom among officers in the eighteenth century, when
uniform was as easy and becoming as any other dress. The usual
dress of an officer, even when on leave, was then his undress
uniform, just as it is now in Continental armies. The change in the
British Army was the direct outcome of the Prince Regent’s tyranny
in buttoning up soldiers to the throat in clothes which it was a
torment to wear.</p>

<p>It must be owned that the Duke of Wellington was in large
measure responsible, inasmuch as he set the example of preferring
easy clothes to uneasy ones. A plain blue frock opening at the
throat to a white cravat was his invariable dress throughout his
campaigns. He had for his own wear a cocked hat one third the
size of the huge one prescribed for general officers. There was a
famous occasion in 1814, after the restoration of Louis XVIII.,
when the King and the Royal Princes, with a brilliant suite, attended
a state performance in the Odéon Theatre. The house was ablaze
with uniforms of many nations and the gay dresses of ladies of the
Court. In a box immediately opposite the royal one sat the Duke—in
plain clothes! ‘The pride that apes humility’? Not a bit.
<i lang="fr">Le vainqueur des vainqueurs</i> could scarcely be suspected of that.
Simply, as he had to sit through a long performance, he chose to
do so in clothes that enabled him to sit in comfort.</p>

<p>Much praiseworthy attention is now given to the equipment
and clothing of British troops serving in hot climates, but it was
otherwise throughout most of the nineteenth century, and it is
incalculable how much suffering, disease, and death was caused by
neglect of any such provision. When Colonel Luard was preparing
his book in 1850-52 he received letters from many officers calling
his attention to this matter. One of these writes:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p2">‘I shall be very glad if you dedicate a portion of your work to
the dress of our soldiers in the colonies.... I have myself seen
the Spanish, French, and Danish troops in the West Indies much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</span>
more healthy than our own, from great attention to their comfort
in their dress.... The whole body of civilians in the tropics
appear in loose white jackets and trousers and a skull-cap ...
the shakoes and red coats of our troops were not altered in our West
India colonies.’</p>
</div>

<p class="p2">A cavalry officer remarks: ‘I hope you will dwell on the madness
of our soldiers wearing leather caps under a tropical sun’;
while another observes that ‘a brass helmet was not found serviceable
in Africa by the 7th Dragoon Guards when that regiment was
at the Cape.’</p>

<p>Our troops suffered horribly during the first Kaffir war, 1846-48,
from being clothed exactly as they had been at home—leather
stocks, tight coatees, heavy shakoes, and all the rest of it. Some
consideration was shown for the soldier in the second Kaffir war,
1851-52. Captain King, of the 74th Highlanders, describes how his
regiment landed at Cape Town (after a voyage from England of
two months!) wearing their ordinary clothing, and it was not until
they had marched far into the interior that ‘our bonnets and plaids
were replaced by a costume more suitable for the bush—viz., a
short dark canvas blouse; in addition to which feldt-schoen and
lighter pouches, made of untanned leather, were issued to the
men, and broad leather peaks affixed to their forage-caps.’<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>Captain King’s narrative is illustrated by lithographs from his
own excellent drawings, which show his men, heavily accoutred
with pack and pouch, and with no protection against the sun except
the aforesaid peak to the forage-cap, severely handicapped in
fighting nearly naked blacks armed with rifles. No wonder the
74th lost heavily, their commander, Colonel Fordyce, falling at
their head in a bush fight, together with some of his best officers.</p>

<p>It is not only in matters of dress and equipment that we have
learnt consideration for our troops on foreign service. The splendid
organisation of the Royal Army Medical Corps has been severely
tested in coping with the requirements of such a force as it was
never contemplated Great Britain would or could put in the field;
but the test has been nobly met; the latest discoveries in science
have been employed to avert disease and mortality from wounds,
thereby saving soldiers and their families and friends from an incalculable
amount of misery. The Transport Service has not only
met the extraordinary demand upon its resources in the conveyance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</span>
of necessary supplies—food, munitions, &amp;c.—but has proved
equal to the punctual deliverance of the vast stores of comforts
and even luxuries consigned from voluntary sources at home.</p>

<p>Among the said luxuries is one whereon the Iron Duke would
have turned no favouring eye. The tobacco which has been
supplied to our troops at the front—aye, and in hospital at home—must
amount to a prodigious figure. When the Duke was Commander-in-Chief
in 1845 he issued the following counterblast:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="p2">‘<abbr title="General Order Number">G.O. No.</abbr> 577.—The Commander-in-Chief has been informed
that the practice of smoking, by the use of pipes, cigars and cheroots,
has become prevalent among the Officers of the Army, which is
not only in itself a species of intoxication occasioned by the fumes
of tobacco, but, undoubtedly, occasions drinking and tippling by
those who acquire the habit; and he intreats the Officers commanding
Regiments to prevent smoking in the Mess Rooms of their
several Regiments, and in the adjoining apartments, and to discourage
the practice among the Officers of Junior Rank in their
Regiments.’</p>
</div>

<p>There was no Press Censor in those days, and <cite>Punch</cite>, which was
then a vigorous stripling in its fourth year, was allowed to make
merry over this fulmination, declaring that officers of the Army
were greatly perturbed, ‘dreading the possibility of being thrown
upon their conversational resources, which must have a most
dreary effect.’ Tobacconists drove a brisk trade in pipe-stoppers
carved in the likeness of the Duke’s head. These might now be
a fitting object of pursuit on the part of collectors.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>THE NEW UBIQUE: SPIT AND POLISH.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center">BY JEFFERY E. JEFFERY.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">‘Per<em>son</em>ally</span> myself,’ said the Child, tilting back his chair until
his head touched the wall behind him, and stretching out a lazy
arm towards the cigarette-box—‘per<em>son</em>ally myself, I’ve enjoyed this
trip no end—haven’t you?’</p>

<p>‘I have,’ I answered; ‘so much so, Child, that the thought of
going back to gun-pits and trenches and O.P.s again fills me
with gloom.’</p>

<p>It was our last night in a most comfortable billet near ——,
where, on and off, we had spent rather more than a month of ease:
on the morrow we were going into the line again. The trip to which
the Child was referring, however, was an eight days’ course at a place
vaguely known as ‘the —th Army Mobile Artillery Training School,’
from which our battery had but lately returned.</p>

<p>The circumstances were these. When, five weeks ago, the division
moved (for the <em>n</em>th time!) to a different part of the line, it
transpired that three batteries would be ‘out at rest,’ as there would
be no room for them in action. It also so chanced that it was our
colonel’s turn to be left without a ‘group’<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> to command. This
being so, he suggested to higher authorities that the three batteries
‘out’ should be those of his own brigade, in order that he might
have a chance ‘to tidy them up a bit,’ as he phrased it. Thus it
was that we found ourselves, as I have said, in extremely comfortable
billets—places, I mean, where they have sheets on the beds and
china jugs and gas and drains—with every prospect of a pleasant
loaf. But in this we were somewhat sanguine.</p>

<p>The colonel’s idea in having us ‘out’ for a while was not so
much to rest us as to give us a variation of work. Being essentially
a thorough man, he started—or rather ordered me to start—at the
very beginning. The gunners paraded daily for marching drill,
physical exercises, and ‘elementary standing gun drill by numbers.’
N.C.O.s and drivers were taken out and given hours of riding drill
under the supervision of subalterns bursting with knowledge
crammed up from the book the night before and under the personal
direction of a brazen-voiced sergeant who, having passed through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</span>
‘riding troop’ at Woolwich in his youth, knew his business. The
strangest sight of all was the class of signallers—men who had spent
months in the fœtid atmosphere of cellars and dug-outs, or creeping
along telephone wires in ‘unhealthy’ spots—now waving flags at a
word of command and going solemnly through the Morse alphabet
letter by letter. Of the whole community this was perhaps the
most scandalised portion. But in a few days, when everybody
(not excluding myself and the other officers) had discovered how
much had been forgotten during our long spell in action, a great
spirit of emulation began to be displayed. Subsections vied with
one another to produce the smartest gun detachment, the sleekest
horses, the best turned-out ride, the cleanest harness, guns, and
wagons.</p>

<p>The colonel, after the manner of his kind, came at the end of a
week or so to inspect things. He is not the sort of man upon whom
one can easily impose. A dozen of the shiniest saddles or bits in
the battery placed so as to catch the light (and the eye) near the
doorway of the harness-room do not necessarily satisfy him: nor
is he content with the mere general and symmetrical effect of rows
of superficially clean breast-collars, traces, and breechings. On
the contrary, he is quite prepared to spend an hour or more over his
inspection, examining every set of harness in minute detail, even
down to the backs of the buckle tongues, the inside of the double-folded
breast collars, and the oft-neglected underside of saddle
flaps. It is the same thing with the guns and wagons. Burnished
breech-rings and polished brasswork look very nice, and he approves
of them, but he does not on that account omit to look closely at
every oil-hole or to check the lists of ‘small stores’ and ‘spare
parts.’</p>

<p>For the next week or so we were kept very busy on ‘the many
small points which required attention,’ to quote the colonel’s phrase.
Nevertheless, as a variation from the monotony of siege warfare,
the time was regarded by most of us as a holiday. Many things
combined to enhance our pleasure. The sun shone and the country
became gorgeously green again; the horses began to get their
summer coats and to lose their unkempt winter’s appearance;
there was a fair-sized town near at hand, and passes to visit it were
freely granted to N.C.O.s and men; at the back of the officers’
billet was a garden with real flower-beds in it and a bit of lawn on
which one could have tea. Occasionally we could hear the distant
muttering of the guns, and at night we could see the ‘flares’ darting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</span>
up from the black horizon—just to remind us, I suppose, that the
war was only in the next parish....</p>

<p>But it was not to be supposed that a man of such energy as our
colonel would be content just to ride round daily and watch three
of his batteries doing rides and gun drill. It occurred to him at
once that this was the time to practise the legitimate business—that
is, open, moving warfare. Wherefore he made representations
to various quite superior authorities. In three days, by dint of
considerable personal exertion, he had secured the following concessions:
two large tracts of ground suitable for driving drill
and battery manœuvre, good billets, an area of some six square
miles (part of the —th Army Training area) for the purpose of
tactical schemes, the appointment of himself as commandant of
the ‘school,’ a Ford ambulance for his private use, three motor
lorries for the supply of the units under training, and a magnificent
château for his own headquarters. And all this he accomplished
without causing any serious friction between the various ‘offices’
and departments concerned—no mean feat.</p>

<p>Each course was to last eight days, and there were to be four
batteries, taken from different divisions, undergoing it simultaneously.
It fell to us to go with the second batch, and we spent
a strenuous week of preparation: it was four months since we had
done any work ‘in the open,’ and we knew, inwardly, that we were
distinctly rusty. We packed up, and at full war strength, transport,
spare horses and all, we marched our sixteen miles to the selected
area. At the half-way halt we met the commander of a battery
of our own brigade returning. He stopped to pass the time of
day and volunteered the information that he was going on leave
that night. ‘And, by Jove!’ he added significantly, ‘I deserve
a bit of rest. Réveillé at 4 <span class="allsmcap">A.M.</span> every morning, out all day wet or
fine, gun drill at every odd moment, schemes, tactical exercises,
everybody at high pressure all the time. The colonel’s fairly in his
element, revels in it, and “strafes” everybody indiscriminately.
But it’s done us all a world of good though. Cheeriho! wish you
luck.’ And he rode on, leaving us rather flabbergasted.</p>

<p>We discovered quite early (on the following morning about
dawn, to be precise) that there had been no exaggeration. We began
with elementary driving drill, and we did four and a half hours of it
straight on end, except for occasional ten-minute halts to rest the
astonished teams. It was wonderful how much we had forgotten
and yet how much came back to us after the first hour or so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</span>
‘I want all your officers to drill the battery in turn,’ said the
colonel. ‘I shall just ride round and correct mistakes.’</p>

<p>He did—with an energy, a power of observation, and a command
of language which I have seldom seen or heard surpassed. But the
ultimate result by mid-day, when all the officers and N.C.O.s were
hoarse, the teams sweating and the carriages caked in oily dust—the
ultimate result was, as the Child politely says, ‘not too stinkin’
awful.’ And it had been good to hear once again the rattle and
bump of the guns and wagons over hard ground, the jingle of harness
and the thud of many hoofs; good to see the teams swing round
together as they wheeled into line or column at a spanking trot;
good above all to remember that <em>this</em> was our job and that the months
spent in concrete gun-pits and double-bricked O.P.s were but a
lengthy prelude to our resumption of it—some day.</p>

<p>In the evening, when the day’s work was over and ‘stables’
finished, we left the tired horses picking over the remains of their
hay and walked down the <i lang="fr">pavé</i> village street, Angelo and I, to look
at the church. Angelo is my eldest but not, as it so happens, my
senior subaltern. Before the war he was a budding architect, with
a taste for painting: hence the nickname, coined by the Child in one
of his more erudite moods.</p>

<p>The church at L—— is very fine. Its square tower is thirteenth
century, its interior is pure Gothic, and its vaulted roof a marvel.
For its size the building is well-nigh perfect. We spent some time
examining the nave and chancel—Angelo, his professional as well as
his artistic enthusiasm aroused, explaining technicalities to me and
making me envious of his knowledge. It was with regret that we
turned away at last, for in spite of the tattered colours of some
French regiment which hung on the north side of the chancel, we
had forgotten the war in the quiet peacefulness of that exquisite
interior. But we were quickly reminded. At the end of the
church, kneeling on one of the rough chairs, was an old peasant
woman: her head was bowed, and the beads dropped slowly through
her twisted fingers. As we crept down the aisle she raised her
eyes—not to look at us, for I think she was unconscious of our
presence—but to gaze earnestly at the altar. Her lips moved in
prayer, but no tear damped her yellow cheek. And, passing out
into the sunlight again, I wondered for whom she was praying—husband,
brother, sons?—whether, still hoping, she prayed for
the living, or, faithfully, for the souls of those lost to her. They
are brave, the peasant women of France....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</span>
Madame our hostess, besides being one of the fattest, was also
one of the most agreeable ladies it has ever been our lot to be billeted
upon. Before we had been in her house ten minutes she had given
us (at an amazing speed) the following information:</p>

<p>Her only remaining son had been wounded and was now a
prisoner in Germany.</p>

<p>She had played hostess continuously since August 1914 to every
kind of soldier, including French motor-bus drivers, Indian chiefs
(<i lang="la">sic</i>), and generals.</p>

<p>English officers arriving after the battle of Loos slept in her
hall for twenty-four hours, woke to have a bath and to eat an
omelette, and then slept the clock round again.</p>

<p>She remembered 1870, in which war her husband had fought.</p>

<p>The Boches were barbarians, but they would never advance now,
though at one time they had been within a few kilometres of her
house.</p>

<p>The lettuce and cabbages in her garden were at our disposal.</p>

<p>She took an enormous interest in the Infant, who is even
younger than the Child and is our latest acquisition.</p>

<p><span lang="fr">‘Regardez donc le petit, comme il est fatigué!’</span> she exclaimed
to me in the tones of an anxious mother—and then added in an
excited whisper, <span lang="fr">‘A-t-il vu les Boches, ce petit sous-lieutenant?’</span></p>

<p>When I assured her not only that he had seen them, but had
fired his guns at them, she was delighted and declared that he
could not be more than sixteen. But here the Infant, considering
that the conversation was becoming personal, intervened, and the
old lady left us to our dinner.</p>

<p>Towards the end of our week we packed up essentials and
marched out to bivouac two nights and fight a two days’ running
battle—directed, of course, by our indefatigable colonel. After
the dead flat ugliness where we had been in action all the winter
and early spring it was a delight to find ourselves in this spacious
undulating country, with its trees and church spires and red-tiled
villages. We fought all day against an imaginary foe, made innumerable
mistakes, all forcibly pointed out by the colonel (who
rode both his horses to a standstill in endeavouring to direct operations
and at the same time watch the procedure of four widely
separated batteries); our imaginary infantry captured ridge
after ridge, and we advanced from position to position ‘in close
support,’ until finally, the rout of the foe being complete, we moved
to our appointed bivouacs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</span>
In peace time it would have been regarded as a quite ordinary
day, boring because of its resemblance to so many others. Now
it was different. True, it was make-believe from start to finish,
without even blank cartridge to give the vaguest hint of reality.
But there was this: at the back of all our minds was the knowledge
that this was a preparation—possibly our last preparation—not
for something in the indefinite future (as in peace time), but
for an occasion that assuredly <em>is</em> coming, perhaps in a few months,
perhaps even in a few weeks. The colonel spoke truly when, at
his first conference, he said:</p>

<p>‘During these schemes you must all of you force yourselves
to imagine that there is a real enemy opposed to you. The Boche
is no fool: he’s got guns, and he knows how to use them. If you
show up on crest lines with a whole battery staff at your heels,
he’ll have the place “registered,” and he’ll smash your show to
bits before you ever get your guns into action at all. <em>Think</em> where
he is likely to be, <em>think</em> what he’s likely to be doing, don’t expose
yourselves unless you must, and above all, <em>get a move on</em>.’</p>

<p>It was a delightful bivouac. We were on the sheltered side of
a little hill, looking south into a wooded valley. Nightingales
sang to us as we lay smoking on our valises after a picnic dinner and
stared dreamily at the stars above us.</p>

<p>‘Jolly, isn’t it?’ said the Child, ‘but I s’pose we wouldn’t be
feeling quite so comfy if it was the real business.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t,’ said Angelo quietly. ‘I was pretending to myself
that we were just a merry camping party, here for pleasure only.
I’d forgotten the war.’</p>

<p>But I had not. I was thinking of the last time I had bivouacked—amongst
the corn sheaves of a harvest that was never gathered,
side by side with friends who were soon to fall, on the night before
the first day of Mons, nearly two years ago.</p>

<p>The following day was more or less a repetition of the first,
except that we made fewer mistakes and ‘dropped into action’
with more style and finish. We were now becoming fully aware
of the almost-forgotten fact that a field battery is designed to be
a mobile unit, and we were just beginning to take shape as such
when our time was over. A day’s rest for the horses and then we
returned to our comfortable rest billets. It had been a strenuous
week, but I think everyone had thoroughly enjoyed it....</p>

<p>We have had two days in which to ‘clean up,’ and now
to-morrow we are to relieve another battery and take our place in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</span>
the line again. Our holiday is definitely over. It will take a little
time to settle down to the old conditions: our week’s practice of
open warfare has spoilt us for this other kind. We who have
climbed hills and looked over miles of rolling country will find an
increased ugliness in our old flat surroundings. It will seem
ludicrous to put our guns into pits again—the guns that we have
seen bounding over rough ground behind the straining teams. To
be cooped up in a brick O.P. staring at a strip of desolation will
be odious after our bivouacs under the stars and our dashes into
action under a blazing sun. Worst of all, perhaps, is the thought
that the battery will be split up again into ‘gun line’ and ‘wagon
line,’ with three miles or more separating its two halves, instead
of its being, as it has been all these weeks, one complete cohesive
unit. But what must be, must be; and it is absurd to grumble.
Moreover—the end is not yet.</p>

<p class="p2">‘Let’s toss up for who takes first turn at the O.P. when the
relief is completed,’ suggested the Child.</p>

<p>‘Wait a minute,’ I said, remembering something suddenly.
‘Do you know what to-day is?’</p>

<p>‘Friday,’ he volunteered, ‘and to-morrow ought to be a half-holiday,
but it won’t be, ’cos we’re going into action.’</p>

<p>I passed the port round again. ‘It’s only a fortnight since we
celebrated the battery’s first birthday,’ I said, ‘but to-day the
Royal Regiment of Artillery is two hundred years old. Let’s
drink its health.’</p>

<p>And we did.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>THE REHABILITATION OF PRIVATE HAGAN.</i></span></h2>

<p class="center">BY ‘MAJOR, R.A.M.C.’</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Private Timothy Hagan</span>, of ‘D’ Company, extracted a box of
matches from his pocket, mechanically lighted a seasoned briar
pipe, and sought inspiration from the log roof of the dugout.</p>

<p>The last of the enemy’s usual evening salvo of shells screamed
above the tree-tops and burst harmlessly in a stubble field. Hagan
did not move. The announcement that the evening meal was
ready equally failed to interest him.</p>

<p>The dugout, efficiently constructed of sand-bags, logs, and
earth, was just large enough for the accommodation of two
improvised beds and blankets. Private Sawyer, the normal
occupant of the other half, was at the moment busy in the kitchen
outside beneath the trees. It was seclusion that Hagan courted,
not protection.</p>

<p>Presently, Sawyer, his face smoke-begrimed and heated, thrust
his head over a sand-bag parapet.</p>

<p>‘Tea ready, cooky,’ he cried.</p>

<p>‘Phwat’s the good ov thay?’ grunted Hagan, dropping his
pipe listlessly. ‘Fed up!’</p>

<p>Sawyer’s eyes dilated in speechless surprise. His rapid scrutiny
of his pal’s downcast features failed to help.</p>

<p>‘’Ullo, what’s wrong, hey?’ he asked, wiping his face with the
back of his hand and dropping into the trench. ‘Can’t yer high-class
stomach relish bully-beef no more? What’s wrong with it?’</p>

<p>Without answering in words Timothy slipped his hand into
the breast pocket of his tunic, produced a much-thumbed envelope,
and slowly unfolded a letter. The sight of the irregular writing
seemed to have an immediate tonic effect upon his demeanour.
His eyes suddenly became suffused with red-blood anger. (He
had learned the habit in more than one barbed-wire scrimmage
against the enemy.) Clenching his fists, he cursed beneath his
breath, thoughtfully, with intent.</p>

<p>‘H’m!’ grunted Sawyer sympathetically.</p>

<p>‘There’s a blighter at home,’ stammered Hagan, ‘phwat is
afeared to do his bit out here’—he hesitated as if to swallow pent-up
gorge—‘of the name of O’Shea—a damned thaivin’ grocer.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</span>
The letter says as how he’s afther walking out wid Kitty Murphy,
as is promised to mesilf.’</p>

<p>‘Ugh, a woman is it?’ breathed Sawyer.</p>

<p>‘And me not able to get me hands on him,’ groaned Hagan.
‘’Tis perishin’ hard.’</p>

<p>The sharp explosions of anti-aircraft shells in rapid succession
overhead caused Sawyer to glance upwards. Shading his eyes
with his hand, he shook his head in disappointment at the marksmanship
displayed, and slipped back again into a sitting posture.</p>

<p>‘What abhart leave ’ome?’ he inquired. ‘The captain says
as ’ow each of us is to ’ave a turn—in doo course.’</p>

<p>‘Bah!’ ejaculated Hagan contemptuously. ‘We all knows
phwat in doo course mains.’ Meditatively refolding his letter, he
consigned it again to its inner pocket. ‘There ain’t no proper
foighting now naither—nothin’ but scrappin’ phwat doesn’t even
kape the blood wharm in yez veins.’ Striking a match on the heel
of his boot, he stared into space and forgot to use it. ‘I be afther
thinkin’, Jock, it is now that I could be sphared, or not at all.’</p>

<p>‘Wot’s wimmin to you now, anyway? ’Tis different with the
married blokes,’ murmured Sawyer. ‘Won’t we both be killed
in doo course?’</p>

<p>‘We will that,’ agreed Hagan. ‘But, all the same, I could not
lie happy loike widout I be afther settlin’ first wid the grocer.’</p>

<p>For some seconds Sawyer did not speak. In the cool calm of
the autumn evening there arose before him the memory of a dozen
little wayside cemeteries marked by stereotyped plain wooden
crosses—the British soldier’s humble badge of honour won. With
a whimsical smile upon his lips he wondered vaguely where his
own resting-place would lie.</p>

<p>‘Ye see, Jock,’ persisted Hagan, ‘’tisn’t as if I was much wanted
here just now.’</p>

<p>Sawyer, turning suddenly, stared hard at his friend’s bronzed
countenance, noted the stern-set jaw, and ceased sucking his pipe.
He had learned to read Tim Hagan’s moods with the accuracy of
much practice in the course of many devious wanderings.</p>

<p>‘Humph! Wot’s the bloomin’ plan of campaign?’ he
demanded. ‘Sneakin’ be’ind mud’eaps, or fightin’ in the open?’</p>

<p>Hagan mechanically refilled his pipe and rammed down the
tobacco with mature deliberation. An indefinite hum of voices
near the company cooking-pots and the sharp bark of a French
75-gun in the near distance accentuated the seclusion of the dugout.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</span>
A dull crimson glow of sunset irradiated a cloudless skyline.
To the rear of the wood the lowing of a cow sounded strangely
out of place. On the left, cutting the winding line of trenches,
lay the long, straight, deserted, <i lang="fr">pavé</i> road leading to the German
lines. The scene, through many days of comparative stagnation,
had grown contemptuously familiar.</p>

<p>‘I’m sick,’ said Hagan, ‘to-morrow morning as iver is.’</p>

<p>Sawyer, gurgling in a characteristic manner meant to denote
mirth, shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Sick is it?’ he commented. ‘Wot’s the complaint, matey?
Some ’as fits; others injures their trigger fingers; some ’as lost
their glasses and carn’t see nothink; some breaks their false teeth
and gets shockin’ pains from the hard biscuits; some ’as pains
in the kidneys; some ’as a narsty corph. ’Tain’t the season for
corphs.’ Rubbing his nose with the back of a begrimed finger, he
relapsed into thought. ‘Some ’as a buzzin’ in the ’ead wot nothink
can cure. Some’—looking serious, he suddenly ended in a grunt—‘’Tain’t
good enough, Tim, me lad, even for the pleasure of punchin’
the ’ead of a stinkin’ grocer. You see, if you only get a few days
in ’orspital, back you come again. If you’re took serious, ’ome
you goes and stays there for a long time and misses everythink
’ere.’ Gripping Hagan’s arm with highly strung fingers, he leaned
nearer. ‘You ain’t goin’ to schrimshank at ’ome if a big push
comes, old pal, are you?’</p>

<p>Hagan’s jaw clenched and his lips moved speechlessly. Then
once more he drew the letter from his pocket and handed it to his
friend.</p>

<p>‘Read that!’ he said. ‘I’m goin’ home.’</p>

<p>Sawyer’s face assumed a sphinx-like gravity. He knew the
proverbial strength of obstinacy, also the amount of that commodity
possessed by Tim Hagan. He smoothed out the paper and
sniffed violently. A faint perfume of cheap scent permeated the
immediate atmosphere. With a grunt, he proceeded to master
the contents of the epistle. So slowly did he progress, however,
that presently even Hagan began to show signs of impatience.
Sawyer was, in truth, merely gaining time for thought.</p>

<p>‘If you’re caught out malingerin’ on active service, Tim,’ he
whispered at length, ‘it won’t be only seven days “confined to
barracks” you will be gettin’ off with.’</p>

<p>With eyes bent upon the crimson skyline, Hagan sighed wearily.</p>

<p>‘’Tis goin’ home I be, Jock,’ he repeated. ‘I’ll be afther<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</span>
marryin’ Kitty Murphy, and thin me sickness will all go and back
it is I’ll come.’</p>

<p>With a groan of despair Sawyer crawled to his feet and, without
another word, walked off in the direction of a ruined château.
He knew there was no immediate urgency. For ordinary cases of
illness the ambulance wagon would not arrive until the morning.
He, therefore, still had all night in which to formulate a plan of
operations. It was, of course, open to him to drop a hint to the
R.A.M.C. orderly, but that would have to be a <i lang="fr">dernier ressort</i>
indeed.</p>

<p>Left to himself, Hagan brooded more sombrely than before.
The regulations regarding reporting sick were perfectly familiar
to him. For a serious case the medical officer could be summoned
within a few minutes. The Field Ambulance advanced dressing-station,
located in a school-house in the nearest village, was not
more than a mile away. Weighing the matter in all its visible
points, he suddenly decided that the rôle of an emergency case
would better fit his purpose than that of the ordinary sick soldier
reporting at the sealed-pattern hour.</p>

<p>To determine was to act. Smearing the perspiration of undue
thought from his forehead, he buttoned his tunic, looked hastily
about the interstices of the sand-bags of the dugout for small valued
possessions, and slipped out beneath the shelter of the trees.</p>

<p>The area lying between the wood and the village where the
Field Ambulance had located its post was alive with troops. The
pavé of the road, upheaved by continuous traffic and an occasional
shell, was not a healthy place for evening exercise, but there was
no order against it. The danger of being shot during the journey
had long become a negligible quantity. A church tower, shell-riddled
and tottering, was the landmark. Behind it Hagan knew
he should find the red-cross flag hanging limply from its pole.</p>

<p>Women, with a horse and cart gathering the wheat in a field
on his left, glanced up with pleasant smile of greeting as he passed.
The orderlies filling a regimental water-cart at the village pump
took no notice of him whatever. Presently, reaching the shadows
of the church, he began to walk slower, then halted. He felt as
if he needed a moment in which to pull himself together. So far
in his life his histrionic sense had never been tested. It is notorious
that even experienced actors occasionally suffer from stage
fright.</p>

<p>A couple of R.A.M.C. orderlies, leaning against the door-post
beneath the red-cross flag, presently noticed a soldier staggering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</span>
towards them and blindly clutching at the empty air. In normal
times their unanimous diagnosis woud have been ‘beer.’ They
knew, however, that in the firing line such could not be.</p>

<p>Hagan, squinting between half-closed eyelashes, staggered
another ten yards, embraced one of the orderlies round the neck,
slid limply to the ground, and, breathing heavily, lay quite still.</p>

<p>In a moment a stretcher was at hand; within a minute the
patient was inside the building. There were only half a dozen
other men to share it with him, as the evening evacuation of sick
and wounded to the Clearing Hospital had already taken place.</p>

<p>‘What’s wrong, matey?’ questioned one of the orderlies,
holding a pannikin of soup to the patient’s lips. ‘Here, drink
this. Wake up! Can you hear me?’</p>

<p>With a shudder Hagan opened his eyes, and, half-rising to his
feet, glared about him. Rolls of wool and bandages, trays of
surgical instruments, splints, buckets, and basins surrounded him
upon all sides.</p>

<p>‘Ah—the hospital!’ he muttered. ‘I remimber now. It is
afther faintin’ I be.’</p>

<p>‘H’m—lie down!’ advised the orderly, pushing him back
on the stretcher. ‘I will call the medical officer. Perhaps he’ll
give you a tot of brandy.’</p>

<p>‘Begob, and I’m all roight, me bhoy,’ asserted Hagan, with
well-assumed eagerness to depart. ‘Give me only foive—or maybe
tin—minutes’ rest and a sip av whater.’</p>

<p>The orderly gave the water, but, none the less, called his officer.
Meanwhile Hagan, with shut eyes, summoned to his aid all medical
knowledge, real and spurious, that had ever crossed his path of
life. The rôle he had assigned to himself was extremely difficult.
Whatever else might be imaginary, the beads of perspiration
bedewing his forehead were certainly genuine enough. In order
to fool a man successfully one requires to know something of his
mental attitude towards the subject in hand. What a medico’s
mind might contain, or what pitfalls it was necessary to beware
of in dealing with him, were points that suddenly assailed the
wretched Tim with terrifying force. In fact, had the R.A.M.C.
officer not arrived within a few moments, it is probable that fear
of superior wisdom would have driven the schemer forth from the
building.</p>

<p>‘Well, my man, what is the matter?’ asked the officer, feeling
his patient’s pulse. ‘Fainted, hey?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, sir,’ asserted the orderly. ‘Fell into my arms.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</span>
Hagan, opening his eyes slowly, shook his head from side to
side, noisily blew out his cheeks, and ‘marked time.’ Adjusting
a stethoscope, the officer examined his chest, grunted, and ordered
his temperature to be taken. That the result would be negative
Hagan knew only too well. Consequently, it seemed obvious that
it behoved him to make the next move.</p>

<p>‘Terrible buzzin’ in me head, sor,’ he breathed.</p>

<p>‘Ah—quite so. Rest and light diet. Overstrain. Perhaps
you will be all right again by morning.’</p>

<p>Emboldened by an initiatory success, Hagan ventured upon
driving the nail still deeper.</p>

<p>‘Lost all feelin’s in me legs, sor,’ he added, with a groan. ‘It—er—has
been comin’ on, sor, for a week; but it wasn’t loikin’ to
go sick I was.’</p>

<p>The medico, with newly awakened interest, bent his eyes upon
the man’s face and silently observed the movements of his rolling
head and eyes. Hagan, gradually ceasing his gyrations, at length
opened his eyes and met the doctor’s absorbed gaze. It was at
that moment—had he but known it—that he sorely needed all
the knowledge available regarding his interrogator. The latter
was by nature a silent man, but that did not interfere with his
power of absorbing details and piecing them together with uncanny
accuracy.</p>

<p>‘A pin, sir?’ suggested the orderly.</p>

<p>‘What for?’ asked the officer blandly.</p>

<p>‘Thought, perhaps, you wanted to test his feelings, sir,’ explained
the zealot.</p>

<p>‘No—er—that is, not to-night,’ answered the officer, suppressing
a half-smile beneath his moustache. ‘We will see what a night’s
rest can do.’</p>

<p>As he watched the tall figure of the doctor sauntering out of
the room, Hagan experienced a sensation of acute alarm. In the
presence of the calm assurance of this man of few words he felt
that he had slipped up somewhere. But where? Loss of all
feeling in the legs was surely a good effort! Glancing at the
orderly, he noticed the man smiling in a peculiar manner as his
officer disappeared from sight. An orderly’s knowledge has its
limitations, even if a doctor’s has not. The more thought he gave
to it the more suspicious did he feel, and a guilty conscience did
not assist matters.</p>

<p>Soup and biscuits were served out for supper. Tim Hagan
could have absorbed both with relish. He felt, however, that such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</span>
diet might not be good for buzzing in the head—and said so. The
night orderly, indifferent to arguments, deposited the food on a
box by his side and departed. The fact, however, that all the
articles of diet had disappeared by morning was by no means lost
upon the day orderly when he returned to duty at the hour of
breakfast.</p>

<p>During the silent watches of the night Hagan had time to think
of many things. He decided that he did not like the look of the
medical officer, nor, indeed, did he know what to make of the orderly.
Could he have fought them hand to hand, he would have known
exactly where he was. In this subtle, silent contest of brains he
was beginning to writhe against an invisible foe which seemed to
be closing in upon him more surely with every tick of his watch.
A change of diagnosis seemed advisable. But, with his scanty
repertoire of diseases, the point was none too easy. In fact, when
the officer unexpectedly stood by his side, he was still so undecided,
that closed eyes and immobility seemed the path of least
resistance.</p>

<p>‘Well, Private Hagan, how are you this morning?’ inquired
the officer, shaking him by the shoulder.</p>

<p>What the answer to the question was Timothy did not know.
He conceded a point, however, by opening his eyes.</p>

<p>The question being repeated with emphasis, an inspiration
gripped him. In a flash his line of country seemed to open out
before him. The dizziness in the head had led to complications.</p>

<p>‘Carn’t hear,’ he blurted.</p>

<p>‘Ah!’ commented the persecutor, raising his eyebrows. ‘Deaf,
are you? That’s bad.’ Perceptibly dropping his voice, he studied
his victim’s face. ‘H’m—I wonder what degree of deafness.
Which is the worst ear?’</p>

<p>With praiseworthy presence of mind, Hagan resisted the impulse
to answer. Staring blankly at the ceiling, he made no sign.</p>

<p>Stepping a pace nearer, the officer spoke louder. Hagan still
made no voluntary response, but the perspiration upon his face
attested to the physical effort.</p>

<p>From the psychological standpoint the doctor was intensely
amused. That Private Timothy Hagan was a clumsy malingerer,
pure and simple, he had no doubt. To prove such a negative
condition however is quite another matter. If proved, the offence
meant a court-martial. As an officer it was his duty to conceal
no crime which could be proved. He was interested, but had little
time just then for fancy cases. Hagan’s facial expression of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</span>
struggling conjecture condemned him, morally, beyond a doubt,
but the production of the self-same expression before the members
of a court-martial could hardly be guaranteed.</p>

<p>It was a six-inch German shell that solved the situation for the
moment. Dropping three hundred yards from the dressing-station
in the middle of the village street it exploded with a roar which
smashed every pane of glass in the building. A second quickly
followed. The R.A.M.C. staff, expectant of they knew not what,
stood listening. Hagan, feeling the eyes of the medical officer
upon him, did not move a muscle.</p>

<p>‘One to you,’ murmured the officer to himself. ‘I don’t believe
a word of it all the same.’ Turning on his heel, he winked to the
orderly and with well-assumed indifference strode to the far end
of the room.</p>

<p>The orderly, quickly stepping round to the head of Hagan’s
stretcher, needed no further instructions. With book and pencil
in hand, he appeared to be engaged upon his ordinary duty of
taking names for the Clearing Hospital.</p>

<p>‘What’s your number, matey?’ he asked quickly.</p>

<p>The wretched competitor, breathing heavily after his recent
mental tension, had dropped his guard.</p>

<p>‘4179,’ he answered promptly.</p>

<p>‘<em>Thank you!</em>’ remarked a bland voice from the doorway.</p>

<p>To state that Hagan could have kicked himself for his stupidity,
is to put the case mildly. Conscious that no words of his could
possibly regain lost ground, he stared blankly at the accusing face
of the officer.</p>

<p>‘It’s all <span class="allsmcap">UP</span>, matey,’ whispered the orderly, indulging in an
open guffaw.</p>

<p>‘Thin I may as well be afther gettin’ on me bhoots,’ remarked
the culprit quietly, rising to his feet. ‘You’ve bin done down,
Tim, me bhoy, and there ain’t no manner av use in kickin’.’</p>

<p>What happened next in that little school-house, as regards points
of detail, has never been actually recorded. That a deafening
explosion resembling the noise of the end of all things earthly,
accompanied by the caving in of the brickwork of the side of the
room, and followed by the collapse of most of the roof, took place
at that moment are facts of history.</p>

<p>‘It has come at last,’ groaned the doctor. ‘Thank God, there
are only a few men in the building.’</p>

<p>A second later, a tottering rafter, swaying beneath its weight of
tiles, fell with a sickening crash and buried him beneath its ruins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</span>
In an instant all had become chaos.</p>

<p>Whatever the damage done, it was probably at an end. Hagan
appreciated that much immediately. That he himself remained
unhurt was a miracle. The orderly, holding both hands to his
head, lay like a log on the floor. Several stretchers, with their
occupants, lay buried beneath the débris of brick and plaster.</p>

<p>‘A fifteen-inch, begob!’ exclaimed Hagan, seizing the orderly
by the shoulders and dragging him into the open air.</p>

<p>The atmosphere outside was still reeking with heavy black
smoke and dust. A cavern in the road, large enough to conceal
a motor-bus, yawned in his path. The heat of action was upon him.
Handing over the orderly to other hands, he did not hesitate.
There were wounded men to be rescued. At any moment a second
shell might follow the first, or more walls might fall. A feeble,
muffled call for help, emanating from the very centre of the
wreckage, arrested his attention. He knew that bland, cool voice
only too well. The available orderlies were already struggling to
remove the wounded and unearth their officer.</p>

<p>Hagan dashed forward. He was a strong man, and in the best
of condition. Without argument, he took command.</p>

<p>To remove the smaller masses of mortared brick was the work
of but a few moments. The men worked at fever heat. The cries
from beneath grew feebler, almost ceased. It was the weight of
long rafters which formed the main obstruction. Without axes
or saws, its removal might be a matter of hours.</p>

<p>Wiping the sweat from his face, Hagan set his teeth and urged
on his party to final effort. But their combined strength was
without avail to clear the rafters. The victim beneath seemed
nearing suffocation with every breath he drew.</p>

<p>Hagan could see only one way, and he took it.</p>

<p>Throwing himself on his face, he insinuated his head beneath
the rafters, and by herculean efforts forced his shoulders to follow.
Tearing away the loose stuff with his hands, whilst the orderlies
endeavoured to ease the weight above him, he at length was able
to gauge the situation accurately. A great beam lay across the
chest of the officer, whose body supported it.</p>

<p>Tim Hagan sweated in an agony as he looked. He had seen
hundreds of men killed in action, but to see his late persecutor
being slowly crushed to death before his eyes was more than he
could bear.</p>

<p>From outside the cries of men with axes reached him.
Immediate action, however, was what was wanted. An instant’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</span>
thought, a whispered, guttural prayer, and he proceeded with his
task.</p>

<p>Rolling with difficulty upon his back, he wriggled himself,
inch by inch, close up beside his now silent antagonist, and with
all the strength in his body pressed upwards until he managed to
relieve the pressure on the other’s chest. Inch by inch he shoved
the unconscious man aside and replaced the latter’s body by his
own. Then, with ears at acutest tension, he listened to the crash
of the axes and wondered how long he could last—how long it
would take him to die.</p>

<p class="p2">Two weeks later, Private Timothy Hagan, propped up in bed,
lay in a hospital at the base. Presently an R.A.M.C. officer,
obviously also more or less convalescent, entered the ward by
means of a wheeled chair and looked about him. Hagan, catching
the visitor’s eye, flushed deeply, laboriously drew a long breath,
and turned away his head. The next minute, the officer, having
given an order to the orderly pushing his chair, was at Hagan’s
side. A word to the orderly, and the two wounded men were
alone.</p>

<p>‘I have come, Hagan, to thank you for my life,’ said the officer.</p>

<p>Hagan nervously rubbed his forehead with his hand, moved his
lips as if framing unspoken words, and drew a deep inspiration.</p>

<p>‘’Twasn’t cowardice, sor,’ he breathed at last. ‘’Twas nought
but a litle gurl at home phwat drew me.’</p>

<p>‘Cowardice! You! You’re one of the pluckiest men I have
ever seen. What do you mean?’</p>

<p>‘I main, sor, whin I was schrimshankin’.’</p>

<p>‘Sh—sh, my man! That little matter is all forgotten.’</p>

<p>‘Yez did have me beat, sor,’ persisted Hagan, with a flash of
humour in his eyes. ‘’Twas too cliver for me you was, sor. ’Twas
the orderly hit me below the belt. He took me unbeknownst,
sor.’</p>

<p>With a light laugh, the medical officer placed his hand upon
the brawny fist of the man beside him.</p>

<p>‘You will get home to see your girl after all, Hagan—in your
own way—and I am glad,’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Is it to be quits then, sor?’</p>

<p>‘Yes—we will call it that,’ agreed the officer. ‘For the time
being, we are quits. Later, I will repay you what is over—if I
ever can.’</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>LADY CONNIE.</i></span><a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchorh2">[11]</a></h2>

<p class="center">BY MRS. HUMPHRY WARD.</p>

<p class="center">CHAPTER <abbr title="Seventeen">XVII</abbr>.</p>

<p class="p2"><span class="smcap">Falloden</span> had just finished a solitary luncheon, in the little dining-room
of the Boar’s Hill cottage. There was a garden door in the
room, and lighting a cigarette, he passed out through it to the
terrace outside. A landscape lay before him, which has often been
compared to that of the Val d’Arno seen from Fiesole, and has
indeed some common points with that incomparable mingling of
man’s best with the best of mountain and river. It was the last
week of October, and the autumn was still warm and windless,
as though there were no shrieking November to come. Oxford,
the beautiful city, with its domes and spires, lay in the hollow
beneath the spectator, wreathed in thin mists of sunlit amethyst.
Behind that ridge in the middle distance ran the river and the
Nuneham woods; beyond rose the long blue line of the Chilterns.
In front of the cottage the ground sank through copse and field to
the river level, the hedge lines all held by sentinel trees, to which
the advancing autumn had given that significance the indiscriminate
summer green denies. The gravely rounded elms with their golden
caps, the scarlet of the beeches, the pale lemon-yellow of the nearly
naked limes, the splendid blacks of yew and fir—they were all
there, mingled in the autumn cup of misty sunshine, like melting
jewels. And among them, the enchanted city shone, fair and
insubstantial, from the depth below; as it were, the spiritual word
and voice of all the scene.</p>

<p>Falloden paced up and down the terrace, smoking and thinking.
That was Otto’s open window. But Radowitz had not yet appeared
that morning, and the ex-scout, who acted butler and valet to
the two men, had brought word that he would come down in the
afternoon, but was not to be disturbed till then.</p>

<p>‘What lunacy made me do it?’ thought Falloden, standing
still at the end of the terrace which fronted the view.</p>

<p>He and Radowitz had been three weeks together. Had he
been of the slightest service or consolation to Radowitz during
that time? He doubted it. That incalculable impulse which had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</span>
made him propose himself as Otto’s companion for the winter still
persisted indeed. He was haunted still by a sense of being ‘under
command’—directed—by a force which could not be repelled.
Ill at ease, unhappy, as he was, and conscious of being quite
ineffective, whether as nurse or companion, unless Radowitz
proposed to ‘throw up,’ he knew that he himself should hold on;
though why, he could scarcely have explained.</p>

<p>But the divergences between them were great; the possibilities
of friction many. Falloden was astonished to find that he disliked
Otto’s little fopperies and eccentricities quite as much as he had
ever done in college days; his finicking dress, his foreign ways in
eating, his tendency to boast about his music, his country, and his
forebears, on his good days, balanced by a brooding irritability
on his bad days. And he was conscious that his own ways and
customs were no less teasing to Radowitz; his Tory habits of
thought, his British contempt for vague sentimentalisms and
heroics, for all that <i lang="fr">panache</i> means to the Frenchman, or ‘glory’
to the Slav.</p>

<p>‘Then why, in the name of common sense, are we living
together?’</p>

<p>He could really give no answer but the answer of ‘necessity’—of
a spiritual ἀνάγκη[ananki]—issuing from a strange tangle of circumstance.
The helpless form, the upturned face of his dying father, seemed
to make the centre of it, and those faint last words, so sharply, and
as it were, dynamically connected with the hateful memory of
Otto’s fall and cry in the Marmion Quad, and the hateful ever-present
fact of his maimed life. Constance too—his scene with her
on the river bank—her letter breaking with him—and then the
soft mysterious change in her—and that passionate involuntary
promise in her eyes and voice, as they stood together in her aunts’
garden—all these various elements, bitter and sweet, were mingled
in the influence which was shaping his own life. He wanted to
forgive himself; and he wanted Constance to forgive him, whether
she married him or no. A kind of sublimated egotism, he said to
himself, after all!</p>

<p>But Otto? What had really made him consent to take up
daily life with the man to whom he owed his disaster? Falloden
seemed occasionally to be on the track of an explanation, which
would then vanish and evade him. He was conscious, however,
that here also, Constance Bledlow was somehow concerned; and,
perhaps, the Pole’s mystical religion. He asked himself, indeed,
as Constance had already done, whether some presentiment of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</span>
doom, together with the Christian doctrines of forgiveness and
vicarious suffering, were not at the root of it? There had been
certain symptoms apparent during Otto’s last weeks at Penfold
known only to the old vicar, to himself and Sorell. The doctors
were not convinced yet of the presence of phthisis; but from various
signs, Falloden was inclined to think that the boy believed himself
sentenced to the same death which had carried off his mother. Was
there then a kind of calculated charity in his act also—but aiming
in his case at an eternal reward?</p>

<p>‘He wants to please God—and comfort Constance—by forgiving
me. I want to please her—and relieve myself, by doing
something to make up to him. He has the best of it! But we
are neither of us disinterested.’</p>

<p class="p2">The manservant came out with a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>‘How is he?’ said Falloden, as he took it, glancing up at a
still curtained window.</p>

<p>The man hesitated.</p>

<p>‘Well, I don’t know, sir, I’m sure. He saw the doctor this
morning, and told me afterwards not to disturb him till three o’clock.
But he rang just now, and said I was to tell you that two ladies
were coming to tea.’</p>

<p>‘Did he mention their names?’</p>

<p>‘Not as I’m aware of, sir.’</p>

<p>Falloden pondered a moment.</p>

<p>‘Tell Mr. Radowitz, when he rings again, that I have gone
down to the college ground for some football, and I shan’t be
back till after six. You’re sure he doesn’t want to see me?’</p>

<p>‘No, sir, I think not. He told me to leave the blind down, and
not to come in again till he rang.’</p>

<p>Falloden put on flannels, and ran down the field paths towards
Oxford, and the Marmion ground, which lay on the hither side of
the river. Here he took hard exercise for a couple of hours, walking
on afterwards to his club in the High Street, where he kept
a change of clothes. He found some old Marmion friends there,
including Robertson and Meyrick, who asked him eagerly after
Radowitz.</p>

<p>‘Better come and see,’ said Falloden. ‘Give you a bread and
cheese luncheon any day.’</p>

<p>They got no more out of him. But his reticence made them
visibly uneasy, and they both declared their intention of coming up
the following day. In both men there was a certain indefinable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">[Pg 373]</span>
change which Falloden soon perceived. Both seemed, at times,
to be dragging a weight too heavy for their youth. At other times,
they were just like other men of their age; but Falloden, who knew
them well, realised that they were both hag-ridden by remorse for
what had happened in the summer. And indeed the attitude of a
large part of the college towards them, and towards Falloden, when
at rare intervals he shewed himself there, could hardly have been
colder or more hostile. The ‘bloods’ were broken up; the dons
had set their faces steadily against any form of ‘ragging’; and
the story of the maimed hand, of the wrecking of Radowitz’s career,
together with sinister rumours as to his general health, had spread
through Oxford, magnifying as they went. Falloden met it all with
a haughty silence; and was but seldom seen in his old haunts.</p>

<p>And presently it had become known, to the stupefaction of
those who were aware of the earlier facts, that victim and
tormentor, the injured and the offender, were living together in the
Boar’s Hill cottage where Radowitz was finishing the composition
required for his second musical examination, and Falloden—having
lost his father, his money and his prospects—was reading
for a prize Fellowship to be given by Merton in December.</p>

<p class="p2">It was already moonlight when Falloden began to climb the long
hill again, which leads up from Folly Bridge to the height on which
stood the cottage. But the autumn sunset was not long over, and
in the mingled light, all the rich colours of the fading woodland
seemed to be suspended in, or fused with, the evening air. Forms
and distances, hedges, trees, moving figures, and distant buildings
were marvellously though dimly glorified; and above the golds
and reds and purples of the misty earth, shone broad and large—an
Achilles shield in heaven—the autumn moon, with one bright star
beside it.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out of the twilight, Falloden became aware of a pony-carriage
descending the hill, and two ladies in it. His blood leapt.
He recognised Constance Bledlow, and he supposed the other lady
was Mrs. Mulholland.</p>

<p>Constance on her side knew in a moment from the bearing
of his head and shoulders who was the tall man approaching
them. She spoke hurriedly to Mrs. Mulholland.</p>

<p>‘Do you mind if I stop and speak to Mr. Falloden?’</p>

<p>Mrs. Mulholland shrugged her shoulders—</p>

<p>‘Do as you like, my dear. Only don’t expect me to be very
forthcoming!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</span>
Constance stopped the carriage, and bent forward.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Falloden!’</p>

<p>He came up to her. Connie introduced him to Mrs. Mulholland,
who bowed coldly.</p>

<p>‘We have just been to see Otto Radowitz,’ said Constance.
‘We found him—very sadly, to-day.’ Her hesitating voice, with
the note of wistful appeal in it, affected him strangely.</p>

<p>‘Yes, it has been a bad day. I haven’t seen him at all.’</p>

<p>‘He gave us tea, and talked a great deal. He was rather
excited. But he looked wretched. And why has he turned against
his doctor?’</p>

<p>‘Has he turned against his doctor?’ Falloden’s tone was one
of surprise. ‘I thought he liked him.’</p>

<p>‘He said he was a croaker, and he wasn’t going to let himself be
depressed by anybody—doctor or no.’</p>

<p>Falloden was silent. Mrs. Mulholland interposed.</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you would like to walk a little way with Mr. Falloden?
I can manage the pony.’</p>

<p>Constance descended. Falloden turned back with her
towards Oxford. The pony-carriage followed at some distance
behind.</p>

<p>Then Falloden talked freely. The presence of the light figure
beside him, in its dark dress and close-fitting cap, seemed to thaw
the chill of life. He began rapidly to pour out his own anxieties,
his own sense of failure.</p>

<p>‘I am the last man in the world who ought to be looking after
him; I know that as well as anybody,’ he said, with emphasis.
‘But what’s to be done? Sorell can’t get away from college. And
Radowitz knows very few men intimately. Neither Meyrick nor
Robertson would be any better than me.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, not so good—not nearly so good!’ exclaimed Constance
eagerly. ‘You don’t know! He counts on you.’</p>

<p>Falloden shook his head.</p>

<p>‘Then he counts on a broken reed. I irritate and annoy him
a hundred times a day.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no—he <em>does</em> count on you,’ repeated Connie in her soft,
determined voice. ‘If you give up, he will be much—much worse
off!’ Then she added after a moment—‘Don’t give up! I—I
ask you!’</p>

<p>‘Then I shall stay.’</p>

<p>They moved on a few steps in silence, till Connie said eagerly—</p>

<p>‘Have you any news from Paris?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</span>
‘Yes, I am going over next week. We wrote in the nick of time.
The whole thing was just being given up—for lack of funds. Now
I have told him he may spend what he pleases, so long as he does
the thing.’</p>

<p>‘Please—mayn’t I help?’</p>

<p>‘Thank you. It’s my affair.’</p>

<p>‘It’ll be very—very expensive.’</p>

<p>‘I shall manage it.’</p>

<p>‘It would be kinder’—her voice shook a little—‘if I might
help.’</p>

<p>He considered it—then said doubtfully—</p>

<p>‘Suppose you provide the records?—the things it plays?
I don’t know anything about music—and I have been racking
my brains to think of somebody in Paris who could look after that
part of it.’</p>

<p>Constance exclaimed. Why, she had several friends in Paris,
in the very thick of the musical world there! She had herself
had lessons all one winter in Paris at the Conservatoire from
a dear old fellow—a Pole, a pupil of Chopin in his youth, and in
touch with the whole Polish colony in Paris, which was steeped
in music.</p>

<p>‘He made love to me a little’—she said laughing—‘I’m sure he’d
do anything for us. I’ll write <em>at once</em>! And there is somebody at
the Embassy—why, of course, I can set all kinds of people to work!’</p>

<p>And her feet began to dance along the road beside him.</p>

<p>‘We must get some Polish music’—she went on—‘There’s that
marvellous young pianist they rave about in Paris—Paderewski.
I’m sure he’d help! Otto has often talked to me about him.
We must have lots of Chopin—and Liszt—though of course he
wasn’t a Pole!—And Polish national songs!—Otto was only telling
me to-day how Chopin loved them—how he and Liszt used to go
about the villages and farms and note them down. Oh we’ll
have a <em>wonderful</em> collection!’</p>

<p>Her eyes shone in her small, flushed face. They walked on fast,
talking and dreaming, till there was Folly Bridge in front of them,
and the beginnings of Oxford. Falloden pulled up sharply.</p>

<p>‘I must run back. We have supper early. Will you come
again?’</p>

<p>She held out her hand. His face beside her, as the moonlight
caught it, stirred in her a sudden, acute sense of delight.</p>

<p>‘Oh yes—we’ll come again. But don’t leave him!—don’t,
please, think of it! He trusts you—he leans on you.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</span>
‘It is kind of you to believe it. But I am no use!’</p>

<p>He put her back into the carriage, bowed formally, and was
gone, running up the hill at an athlete’s pace.</p>

<p>The two ladies drove silently on, and were soon amongst the
movement and traffic of the Oxford streets. Connie’s mind was
steeped in passionate feeling. Till now Falloden had touched
first her senses, then her pity. Now in these painful and despondent
attempts of his to adjust himself to Otto’s weakness and irritability,
he was stirring sympathies and enthusiasms in her which belonged
to that deepest soul in Connie which was just becoming conscious
of itself. And all the more, perhaps, because in Falloden’s manner
towards her there was nothing left of the lover. For the moment
at any rate she preferred it so. Life was all doubt, expectation,
thrill—its colour heightened, its meanings underlined. And in
her complete uncertainty as to what turn it would take, and how
the doubt would end, lay the spell—the potent tormenting charm—of
the situation.</p>

<p>She was sorry, bitterly sorry for Radowitz—the victim. But
she loved Falloden—the offender! It was the perennial injustice
of passion, the eternal injustice of human things.</p>

<p>When Falloden was half-way up the hill, he left the road,
and took a short cut through fields, by a path which led him to
the back of the cottage, where its sitting-room window opened on
the garden and the view. As he approached the house, he saw
that the sitting-room blinds had not been drawn, and some of
the windows were still open. The whole room was brilliantly lit
by fire and lamp. Otto was there alone, sitting at the piano,
with his back to the approaching spectator and the moonlit night
outside. He was playing something with his left hand; Falloden
could see him plainly. Suddenly, he saw the boy’s figure collapse.
He was still sitting, but his face was buried in his arms which were
lying on the piano; and through the open window, Falloden heard
a sound which, muffled as it was, produced upon him a strange
and horrible impression. It was a low cry, or groan—the voice
of despair itself.</p>

<p>Falloden stood motionless. All he knew was that he would
have given anything in the world to recall the past; to undo the
events of that June evening in the Marmion quadrangle.</p>

<p>Then, before Otto could discover his presence, he went noiselessly
round the corner of the house, and entered it by the front
door. In the hall, he called loudly to the ex-scout, as he went upstairs,
so that Radowitz might know he had come back. When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</span>
he returned, Radowitz was sitting over the fire with sheets of
scribbled music paper on a small table before him. His eyes shone,
his cheeks were feverishly bright. He turned with forced gaiety
at the sight of Falloden—</p>

<p>‘Well, did you meet them on the road?’</p>

<p>‘Lady Constance, and her friend? Yes. I had a few words with
them. How are you now? What did the doctor say to you?’</p>

<p>‘What on earth does it matter!’ said Radowitz impatiently.
‘He was just a fool—a young one—the worst sort—I can put up
with the old ones. I know my own case a great deal better than
he does.’</p>

<p>‘Does he want you to stop working?’ Falloden stood on the
hearth, looking down on the huddled figure in the chair; himself
broad and tall and curly-haired, like the divine Odysseus, when
Athene had breathed ambrosial youth upon him. But he was
pale, and his eyes frowned perpetually under his splendid brows.</p>

<p>‘Some nonsense of that sort!’ said Radowitz. ‘Don’t let’s
talk about it.’</p>

<p>They went in to dinner, and Radowitz sent for champagne.</p>

<p>‘That’s the only sensible thing the idiot said—that I might
have that stuff whenever I liked.’</p>

<p>His spirits rose with the wine; and presently Falloden could
have thought what he had seen from the dark had been a mere
illusion. A review in <cite>The Times</cite> of a book of Polish memoirs
served to let loose a flood of boastful talk, which jarred abominably
on the Englishman. Under the Oxford code, to boast in plain
language of your ancestors, or your own performances, meant simply
that you were an outsider, not sure of your footing. If a man really
had ancestors, or more brains than other people, his neighbours
saved him the trouble of talking about them. Only the fools
and the <i lang="fr">parvenus</i> trumpeted themselves; a process in any case
not worth while, since it defeated its own ends. You might of
course be as insolent or arrogant as you pleased; but only an
idiot tried to explain why.</p>

<p>In Otto, however, there was the characteristic Slav mingling of
quick wits with streaks of childish vanity. He wanted passionately
to make this tough Englishman feel what a great country Poland
had been and would be again; what great people his ancestors had
been; and what a leading part they had played in the national
movements. And the more he hit against an answering stubbornness—or
coolness—in Falloden, the more he held forth. So that
it was an uncomfortable dinner. And again Falloden said to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</span>
himself—‘Why did I do it? I am only in his way. I shall bore
and chill him; and I don’t seem to be able to help it.’</p>

<p>But after dinner, as the night frost grew sharper, and as
Otto sat over the fire, piling on the coal, Falloden suddenly
went and fetched a warm Scotch plaid of his own. When
he offered it, Radowitz received it with surprise, and a little
annoyance.</p>

<p>‘I am not the least cold—thank you!’</p>

<p>But, presently, he had wrapped it round his knees; and some
restraint had broken down in Falloden.</p>

<p>‘Isn’t there a splendid church in Cracow?’ he asked casually,
stretching himself, with his pipe, in a long chair on the opposite
side of the fire.</p>

<p>‘One!—five or six!’ cried Otto, indignantly. ‘But I expect
you’re thinking of Panna Marya. Panna means Lady. I tell
you, you English haven’t got anything to touch it!’</p>

<p>‘What’s it like?—what date?’—said Falloden, laughing.</p>

<p>‘I don’t know—I don’t know anything about architecture.
But it’s glorious. It’s all colour and stained glass—and magnificent
tombs—like the gate of Heaven,’ said the boy with ardour. ‘It’s
the church that every Pole loves. Some of my ancestors are
buried there. And it’s the church where, instead of a clock
striking, the hours are given out by a watchman who plays a horn.
He plays an old air—ever so old—we call it the “Heynal,” on the
top of one of the towers. The only time I was ever in Cracow
I heard a man at a concert—a magnificent player—improvise
on it. And it comes into one of Chopin’s sonatas.’</p>

<p>He began to hum under his breath a sweet wandering melody.
And suddenly he sprang up, and ran to the piano. He played the
air with his left hand, embroidering it with delicate arabesques and
variations, catching a bass here and there with a flying touch, suggesting
marvellously what had once been a rich and complete whole.
The injured hand, which had that day been very painful, lay helpless
in its sling; the other flashed over the piano, while the boy’s blue
eyes shone beneath his vivid frieze of hair. Falloden, lying back
in his chair, noticed the emaciation of the face, the hollow eyes,
the contracted shoulders; and as he did so, he thought of the
scene in the Magdalen ballroom—the slender girl, wreathed in
pearls, and the brilliant foreign youth—dancing, dancing, with all
the eyes of the room upon them.</p>

<p>Presently, with a sound of impatience, Radowitz left the piano.
He could do nothing that he wanted to do. He stood at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</span>
window for some minutes looking out at the autumn moon, with
his back to Falloden.</p>

<p>Falloden took up one of the books he was at work on for his
Fellowship exam. When Radowitz came back to the fire, however,
white and shivering, he laid it down again, and once more made
conversation. Radowitz was at first unwilling to respond. But he
was by nature <i lang="fr">bavard</i>, and Falloden played him with some skill.</p>

<p>Very soon he was talking fast and brilliantly again, about his
artistic life in Paris, his friends at the Conservatoire or in the
Quartier Latin; and so back to his childish days in Poland, and
the rising of ’63, in which the family estates near Warsaw had been
forfeited. Falloden found it all very strange. The seething,
artistic, revolutionary world which had produced Otto was wholly
foreign to him; and this patriotic passion for a dead country
seemed to his English common sense a waste of force. But in
Otto’s eyes Poland was not dead; the white eagle, torn and bloodstained
though she was, would mount the heavens again; and in
those dark skies the stars were already rising!</p>

<p>At eleven, Falloden got up—</p>

<p>‘I must go and swat. It was awfully jolly, what you’ve been
telling me. I know a lot I didn’t know before.’</p>

<p>A gleam of pleasure shewed in the boy’s sunken eyes.</p>

<p>‘I expect I’m a bore,’ he said, with a shrug; ‘and I’d better
go to bed.’</p>

<p>Falloden helped him carry up his plaid, his books and papers.
In Otto’s room, the windows were wide open, but there was a
bright fire, and Bateson the scout was waiting to help him undress.
Falloden asked some questions about the doctor’s orders. Various
things were wanted from Oxford. He undertook to get them in the
morning.</p>

<p>When he came back to the sitting-room, he stood some time
in a brown study. He wondered again whether he had any qualifications
at all as a nurse. But he was inclined to think now that
Radowitz might be worse off without him; what Constance had
said seemed less unreal; and his effort of the evening, as he looked
back on it, brought him a certain bitter satisfaction.</p>

<p class="p2">The following day, Radowitz came downstairs with the course
of the second movement of his symphony clear before him.
He worked feverishly all day, now writing, now walking up and
down, humming and thinking, now getting out of his piano—a
beautiful Erard hired for the winter—all that his maimed state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</span>
allowed him to get; and passing hour after hour, between an
ecstasy of happy creation, and a state of impotent rage with his
own helplessness. Towards sunset he was worn out, and with tea
beside him which he had been greedily drinking, he was sitting
huddled over the fire, when he heard someone ride up to the front
door.</p>

<p>In another minute the sitting-room door opened, and a girl’s
figure in a riding habit appeared.</p>

<p>‘May I come in?’ said Connie, flushing rather pink.</p>

<p>Otto sprang up, and drew her in. His fatigue disappeared as
though by magic. He seemed all gaiety and force.</p>

<p>‘Come in! Sit down and have some tea! I was so depressed
five minutes ago—I was fit to kill myself. And now you make the
room shine—you come in like a goddess!’</p>

<p>He busied himself excitedly in putting a chair for her, in
relighting the spirit kettle, in blowing up the fire.</p>

<p>Constance meanwhile stood in some embarrassment with one
hand on the back of a chair—a charming vision in her close fitting
habit, and the same black <i lang="fr">tricorne</i> that she had worn in the Lathom
Woods, at Falloden’s side.</p>

<p>‘I came to bring you a book, dear Mr. Otto, the book we talked
of yesterday.’ She held out a paper-covered volume. ‘But I
mustn’t stay.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, do stay!’ he implored her. ‘Don’t bother about Mrs.
Grundy. I’m so tired and so bored. Anybody may visit an invalid.
Think this is a nursing home, and you’re my daily visitor.
Falloden’s miles away on a drag-hunt. Ah, that’s right!’ He
waved his hand as he saw that she had seated herself. ‘Now
you shall have some tea!’</p>

<p>She let him provide her, watching him the while with slightly
frowning brows. How ill he looked—how ill! Her heart sank.</p>

<p>‘Dear Mr. Otto, how are you? You don’t seem so well
to-day.’</p>

<p>‘I have been working myself to death. It won’t come right—this
beastly <cite>Andante</cite>. It’s too jerky—it wants <em>liaison</em>. And I
can’t hear it—I can’t <em>hear</em> it!—that’s the devilish part of it.’</p>

<p>And taking his helpless hand out of the sling in which it had
been resting, he struck it bitterly against the arm of his chair.
The tears came to Connie’s eyes.</p>

<p>‘Don’t!—you’ll hurt yourself. It’ll be all right—it’ll be all
right! You’ll hear it in your mind.’ And bending forward under
a sudden impulse, she took the maimed hand in her two hands—so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</span>
small and soft—and lifting it tenderly she put her lips
to it.</p>

<p>He looked at her in amazement.</p>

<p>‘You do that—for me?’</p>

<p>‘Yes. Because you are a great artist—and a brave man!’
she said, gulping. ‘You are not to despair. Your music is in your
soul—your brain. Other people shall play it for you.’</p>

<p>He calmed down.</p>

<p>‘At least I am not deaf, like Beethoven,’ he said, trying to
please her. ‘That would have been worse.—Do you know last
night, Falloden and I had a glorious talk. He was awfully decent.
He made me tell him all about Poland, and my people. He never
scoffed once. He makes me do what the doctor says. And last
night—when it was freezing cold—he brought a rug and wrapped it
round me. Think of that!’—he looked at her—half-shamefaced,
half-laughing—‘<em>Falloden!</em>’</p>

<p>Her eyes shone.</p>

<p>‘I’m glad!’ she said softly. ‘I’m glad!’</p>

<p>‘Yes, but do you know why he’s kind—why he’s here at all?’
he asked her, abruptly.</p>

<p>‘What’s the good of silly questions?’ she said hastily. ‘Take
it as it comes.’</p>

<p>He laughed.</p>

<p>‘He does it—I’m going to say it!—yes, I <em>am</em>—and you are not
to be angry—he does it because—simply—he’s in love with <em>you</em>!’</p>

<p>Connie flushed again, more deeply, and he, already alarmed by
his own boldness, looked at her nervously.</p>

<p>‘You are quite wrong.’ Her tone was quiet, but decided.
‘He did it, first of all, because of what you did for his father——’</p>

<p>‘I did nothing!’ interposed Radowitz.</p>

<p>She took no notice.</p>

<p>‘And secondly’—her voice shook a little—‘because—he was
sorry. Now—<em>now</em>—he is doing it’—suddenly her smile flashed
out, with its touch of humour—‘just simply because he likes it!’</p>

<p>It was a bold assertion. She knew it. But she straightened
her slight shoulders, prepared to stick to it.</p>

<p>Radowitz shook his head.</p>

<p>‘And what am I doing it for? Do you remember when I said
to you I loathed him?’</p>

<p>‘No—not him.’</p>

<p>‘Well, something in him—the chief thing, it seemed to me then.
I felt towards him really—as a man might feel towards his murderer—or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</span>
the murderer of someone else, some innocent, helpless person
who had given no offence. Hatred—loathing—<em>abhorrence!</em>—you
couldn’t put it too strongly. Well then,’—he began to fidget with
the fire, tongs in hand, building it up, while he went on thinking
aloud—‘God brought us together in that strange manner. By the
way’—he turned to her—‘are you a Christian?’</p>

<p>‘I—I don’t know. I suppose I am.’</p>

<p>‘I am,’ he said firmly. ‘I am a practising Catholic.
Catholicism with us Poles is partly religion, partly patriotism—do
you understand? I go to confession—I am a communicant.
And for some time I couldn’t go to Communion at all. I always
felt Falloden’s hand on my shoulder, as he was pushing me down
the stairs; and I wanted <em>to kill him</em>!—just that! You know our
Polish blood runs hotter than yours. I didn’t want the college to
punish him. Not at all. It was my affair. After I saw you in
town, it grew worse—it was an obsession. When we first got to
Yorkshire, Sorell and I, and I knew that Falloden was only a few
miles away, I never could get quit of it—of the thought that some
day—somewhere—I should kill him. I never, if I could help it,
crossed a certain boundary line that I had made for myself, between
our side of the moor, and the side which belonged to the Fallodens.
I couldn’t be sure of myself if I had come upon him unawares.
Oh, of course, he would soon have got the better of me—but there
would have been a struggle—I should have attacked him—and
I might have had a revolver. So for your sake’—he turned to
look at her with his hollow blue eyes—‘I kept away. Then, one
evening, I quite forgot all about it. I was thinking of the theme
for the slow movement in my symphony, and I didn’t notice where
I was going. I walked on and on over the hill—and at last I heard
a man groaning—and there was Sir Arthur—by the stream. I saw
at once that he was dying, and I took a card from his waistcoat
pocket, which told me who he was. There I sat, alone with him.
He asked me not to leave him. He said something about Douglas.
“Poor Douglas!” And when the horrible thing came back—the
last time—he just whispered, “Pray!” and I said our Catholic
prayers—that our priest had said when my mother died. Then
Falloden came—just in time—and instead of wanting to kill him,
I waited there, a little way off—and prayed hard for myself and
him! Queer, wasn’t it? And afterwards—you know—I saw his
mother. Then the next day, I confessed to a dear old priest, who
was very kind to me, and on the Sunday he gave me Communion.
He said God had been very gracious to me; and I saw what he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</span>
meant. That very week I had a hæmorrhage, the first I ever
had.’</p>

<p>Connie gave a sudden, startled cry. He turned again to smile
at her.</p>

<p>‘Didn’t you know? No, I believe no one knew, but Sorell and
the doctors. It was nothing. It’s quite healed. But the strange
thing was how extraordinarily happy I felt that week. I didn’t
hate Falloden any more. It was as though a sharp thorn had gone
from one’s mind. It didn’t last long of course, the queer ecstatic
feeling. There was always my hand—and I got very low again.
But <em>something</em> lasted; and when Falloden said that extraordinary
thing—I don’t believe he meant to say it at all!—suggesting we
should settle together for the winter—I knew that I must do it.
It was a kind of miracle—one thing after another—<em>driving</em> us.’</p>

<p>His voice dropped. He remained gazing absently into the fire.</p>

<p>‘Dear Otto’—said Constance softly—‘you have forgiven him?’</p>

<p>He smiled.</p>

<p>‘What does that matter? <em>Have you?</em>’</p>

<p>His eager eyes searched her face. She faltered under them.</p>

<p>‘He doesn’t care whether I have or not.’</p>

<p>At that he laughed out.</p>

<p>‘Doesn’t he? I say, did you ask us both to come—on purpose—that
afternoon?—in the garden?’</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>‘It was bold of you!’ he said, in the same laughing tone. ‘But
it’s answered. Unless, of course, I bore him to death. I talk
a lot of nonsense—I can’t help it—and he bears it. And he says
hard, horrid things, sometimes—and my blood boils—and I bear it.
And I expect he wants to break off a hundred times a day—and
so do I. Yet here we stay. And it’s <em>you</em>’—he raised his head
deliberately—‘it’s <em>you</em> that are really at the bottom of it.’</p>

<p>Constance rose trembling from her chair.</p>

<p>‘Don’t say any more, dear Otto. I didn’t mean any harm.
I—I was so sorry for you both.’</p>

<p>He laughed again.</p>

<p>‘You’ve got to marry him!’ he said triumphantly. ‘There!—you
may go now—But you’ll come again soon. I know you
will!’</p>

<p>She seemed to slip, to melt, out of the room. But he had a
last vision of flushed cheeks, and half-reproachful eyes.</p>

<h2><span class="h3head"><i>TO THE EDITOR OF THE ‘CORNHILL.’</i></span></h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,—If it gives Mr. Russell any pleasure to accuse me of
‘living in a happy remoteness from affairs,’ and of having ‘only just
awakened from a slumber which seems to have lasted longer than
that of Rip Van Winkle,’ it would be cruel of me to object. But
the proof of my guilt, it seems, is to be found in the article I wrote
in the <span class="smcap">Cornhill</span> on ‘The Duke of Wellington and Miss J.’ That
article, Mr. Russell thinks, proves that I had only just discovered
Miss J. and her correspondence with the Duke. As a matter of
fact I have been familiar with the volume published by Mr. T.
Fisher Unwin for more than twenty years, and it must be fifteen years
ago since I wrote an article on the subject in an Australian magazine.
But Mr. Russell himself thinks the letters of Miss J. so little known,
and so very interesting, that he himself expends another article
on them, three months later than mine, and taking exactly the
same view of them! It seems clear that there are two Rip Van
Winkles—one in England and one in Australia: and the English
Van Winkle is even drowsier, and wakes later, than his Australian
kinsman.</p>

<p>I should not trouble you with this note, however, except for
the opportunity it gives me of apologising for an injustice to Sir
Herbert Maxwell which I committed in the article I wrote in the
<span class="smcap">Cornhill</span>. I represented him as saying the Duke ‘must have
been inexpressibly bored by the correspondence,’ and the words
are in inverted commas, giving the reader the impression these
were the exact words Sir Herbert Maxwell used. I apologise for
those unfortunate inverted commas. The words they seem to quote
were not the precise words Sir Herbert Maxwell used in his ‘Life
of Wellington,’ and they do not accurately convey his meaning.
‘The letters,’ he says, ‘<em>some might think</em> were of the very kind to
bore the Duke, whose religion was of a somewhat conventional
kind.’ But Sir Herbert Maxwell does not say that that was his
personal opinion.</p>
